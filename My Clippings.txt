Failure to engage the whole drama of Scripture, including the opening and closing scenes, may partially explain why we have little vision for a LIFE WITH GOD. But we must also recognize that we live neither in the garden of Eden nor in the New Jerusalem. Our lives, and all recorded history, exist between these two paradises. And while the scenes in Genesis and Revelation show a world of beauty, order, and life-giving abundance, such things are difficult to find in our experience.

This is the third great failure of the LIFE OVER GOD approach—it causes us to gauge success based on effective outcomes rather than faithfulness to God’s calling. While studies may be able to tell us which principles of life, business, and ministry work, a research method has not yet been created that can determine whether a principle is right. In many places we simply assume that God values effectiveness as much as we do.

At the H.O.D., drinking functioned as an alternative code of ethics—one that valued authenticity more than sobriety.

LIFE FOR GOD takes our fear of insignificance and throws gasoline on it. The resulting fire may be presented to the world as a godly ambition, a holy desire to see God’s mission advance—the kind of drive evident in the apostle Paul’s life. But when these flames are fueled by fear, they reveal none of the peace, joy, or love displayed by Paul. The relentless drive to prove our worth can quickly become destructive.

J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings, often employed a storytelling device he called eucatastrophe. A catastrophe is an unexpected evil, but Tolkien added the Greek prefix eu- meaning “good” to express the unexpected appearing of goodness. He defined it as “the sudden happy turn in a story which pierces you with a joy that brings you to tears.” It has this effect on us “because it is a sudden glimpse of Truth” in which we “feel a sudden relief as if a major limb out of joint had suddenly snapped back.”

Faith is the opposite of seeking control. It is surrendering control. It embraces the truth that control is an illusion—we never had it and we never will. Rather than trying to overcome our fears by seeking more control, the solution offered by LIFE WITH GOD is precisely the opposite—we overcome fear by surrendering control. But surrender is only possible if we have total assurance that we are safe. We must be convinced that if we let go we will be caught. This assurance only comes when we trust that our heavenly Father desires to be with us and will not let us fall.

The comments continued along these lines for the remainder of the hour. Words like unrealistic, impossible, and foolish were frequently used to describe Jesus’ teaching. The class generally believed that anyone trying to live as Jesus taught would either be miserable because of their failure to do it, or as stupid as the sheep who went over the cliff. In a dangerous world, obeying the Sermon on the Mount was tantamount to suicide.

LIFE UNDER, OVER, FROM, and FOR GOD promise deliverance from fear and danger, but the control they offer is an illusion eventually shattered by the uncontrollable certainty of death. But those who live with God are set free from fear. Releasing control we surrender ourselves to his care knowing that our Good Shepherd will walk with us even through the shadow of the valley of death, where we will fear no evil, until we come to dwell in his house forever.

This is the shortcoming of seeking hope and meaning from external conformity to a religion—it fails to truly rehabilitate us. It does not bring real dignity and significance to a person unless he or she perfectly conforms to expectations. This may help explain why increasing numbers of people are either leaving the institutional church or feeling unaccepted within it. When their lives are marked by divorce, addiction, same-sex attraction, or something else deemed “unrighteous,” the dignity they long for is withheld.

In other words, the fullness of Christian life can be lived anywhere, in any circumstance, because God is with us. No condition of life is more honorable than another, because nothing God does lacks value. If he is with us in marriage or singleness, and in the garage, the office, or the home, then these very different lives are each significant. Each of them carries the same dignity and hope.

The hush harbors brought hope to the slaves at both the cosmic and individual levels. At the higher level, the slaves often compared themselves to the Israelite slaves in Egypt awaiting God’s deliverance. They knew that freedom was their destiny. “I know that some day we’ll be free and if we die before that time our children will live to see it.”22 At the lower level, many of the slaves found that communion with God gave them a peace and dignity that defied their circumstances.

While Jacob was kneeling in the field to pray one day, Saunders came up to him and pointed a gun at his head. Saunders ordered him to stop praying and to get back to work. Jacob finished his prayer and then invited Saunders to pull the trigger. “Your loss will be my gain,” he said. “I have two masters—Master Jesus in heaven, and Master Saunders on earth. I have a soul and a body; the body belongs to you, but my soul belongs to Jesus.” Saunders was so shaken by Jacob’s strength and lack of fear that he never touched him again.23

Given her seemingly endless reservoir of love, it is not surprising to learn that Mother Antonia began each day at 5:00 a.m. with an hour of prayer and Scripture reading. The Bible illuminated a clear vision of God for her by driving away the shadows of the world that seek to hide and distort our view, and in silence she communed intimately with him. It was this time set apart for silence and solitude that filled her reservoir of love.

Why is it so important that you are with God and God alone. . . ? It’s important because it’s the place in which you can listen to the voice of the One who calls you the beloved. To pray is to listen to the One who calls you “my beloved daughter,” “my beloved son,” “my beloved child.” To pray is to let that voice speak to the center of your being, to your guts, and let that voice resound in your whole being.6

If we return to Nouwen’s trapeze analogy, we can see the transient nature of both faith and hope. Faith is the courage to release the trapeze trusting that the Catcher will rescue us. Hope is the peace and assurance we experience as we soar untethered through the air knowing the Catcher will not let us fall. But once we are caught, once we are safely and fully in his grasp, faith and hope disappear. All that remains is the love between the Catcher and the caught. “Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.”16

The apostle John captured this moment in Revelation 2. Speaking to his people who were struggling and persecuted, Jesus promised to give them “a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it.”19 The meaning of this stone and the new name is rooted in ancient symbolism. It was customary in John’s day to use small tablets, often made of wood, stone, or metal, as a token of admission. It seems Jesus was offering those who overcome a ticket into his presence and the heavenly banquet.

Many people struggle with honesty in this practice. Very often we will think back to a conversation or event from the day and dwell on how we should have acted or what we ought to have said. The goal of the examen is not to reflect on what could, should, or ought to have happened, but rather to be honest with yourself, with the Holy Spirit’s help, about what did happen and how you actually felt. At times this will prompt confession of sin, but it is also an opportunity for self-examination and for God to reveal the truth about you.

There’s things that move a man. Like currents of water inside. Things he can’t help. Older I got, the more I found it true. What’s in Stag is like water so black and deep you can’t see the bottom. Stag was laughing now. But then Pop said: Parchman taught me the same in me, Philomène. Some days later, I understood what he was trying to say, that getting grown means learning how to work that current: learning when to hold fast, when to drop anchor, when to let it sweep you up. And it could be something simple as sex, or it could be something as complicated as falling in love, or it could be like going to jail with your brother, thinking you going to protect him.”
