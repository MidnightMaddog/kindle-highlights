Failure to engage the whole drama of Scripture, including the opening and closing scenes, may partially explain why we have little vision for a LIFE WITH GOD. But we must also recognize that we live neither in the garden of Eden nor in the New Jerusalem. Our lives, and all recorded history, exist between these two paradises. And while the scenes in Genesis and Revelation show a world of beauty, order, and life-giving abundance, such things are difficult to find in our experience.

This is the third great failure of the LIFE OVER GOD approach—it causes us to gauge success based on effective outcomes rather than faithfulness to God’s calling. While studies may be able to tell us which principles of life, business, and ministry work, a research method has not yet been created that can determine whether a principle is right.

At the H.O.D., drinking functioned as an alternative code of ethics—one that valued authenticity more than sobriety.

LIFE FOR GOD takes our fear of insignificance and throws gasoline on it. The resulting fire may be presented to the world as a godly ambition, a holy desire to see God’s mission advance—the kind of drive evident in the apostle Paul’s life. But when these flames are fueled by fear, they reveal none of the peace, joy, or love displayed by Paul. The relentless drive to prove our worth can quickly become destructive.

J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings, often employed a storytelling device he called eucatastrophe. A catastrophe is an unexpected evil, but Tolkien added the Greek prefix eu- meaning “good” to express the unexpected appearing of goodness. He defined it as “the sudden happy turn in a story which pierces you with a joy that brings you to tears.” It has this effect on us “because it is a sudden glimpse of Truth” in which we “feel a sudden relief as if a major limb out of joint had suddenly snapped back.”

Faith is the opposite of seeking control. It is surrendering control. It embraces the truth that control is an illusion—we never had it and we never will. Rather than trying to overcome our fears by seeking more control, the solution offered by LIFE WITH GOD is precisely the opposite—we overcome fear by surrendering control. But surrender is only possible if we have total assurance that we are safe. We must be convinced that if we let go we will be caught. This assurance only comes when we trust that our heavenly Father desires to be with us and will not let us fall.

The comments continued along these lines for the remainder of the hour. Words like unrealistic, impossible, and foolish were frequently used to describe Jesus’ teaching. The class generally believed that anyone trying to live as Jesus taught would either be miserable because of their failure to do it, or as stupid as the sheep who went over the cliff. In a dangerous world, obeying the Sermon on the Mount was tantamount to suicide.

This is the shortcoming of seeking hope and meaning from external conformity to a religion—it fails to truly rehabilitate us. It does not bring real dignity and significance to a person unless he or she perfectly conforms to expectations. This may help explain why increasing numbers of people are either leaving the institutional church or feeling unaccepted within it. When their lives are marked by divorce, addiction, same-sex attraction, or something else deemed “unrighteous,” the dignity they long for is withheld.

In other words, the fullness of Christian life can be lived anywhere, in any circumstance, because God is with us. No condition of life is more honorable than another, because nothing God does lacks value. If he is with us in marriage or singleness, and in the garage, the office, or the home, then these very different lives are each significant. Each of them carries the same dignity and hope.

While Jacob was kneeling in the field to pray one day, Saunders came up to him and pointed a gun at his head. Saunders ordered him to stop praying and to get back to work. Jacob finished his prayer and then invited Saunders to pull the trigger. “Your loss will be my gain,” he said. “I have two masters—Master Jesus in heaven, and Master Saunders on earth. I have a soul and a body; the body belongs to you, but my soul belongs to Jesus.” Saunders was so shaken by Jacob’s strength and lack of fear that he never touched him again.23

Given her seemingly endless reservoir of love, it is not surprising to learn that Mother Antonia began each day at 5:00 a.m. with an hour of prayer and Scripture reading. The Bible illuminated a clear vision of God for her by driving away the shadows of the world that seek to hide and distort our view, and in silence she communed intimately with him. It was this time set apart for silence and solitude that filled her reservoir of love.

Why is it so important that you are with God and God alone. . . ? It’s important because it’s the place in which you can listen to the voice of the One who calls you the beloved. To pray is to listen to the One who calls you “my beloved daughter,” “my beloved son,” “my beloved child.” To pray is to let that voice speak to the center of your being, to your guts, and let that voice resound in your whole being.6

If we return to Nouwen’s trapeze analogy, we can see the transient nature of both faith and hope. Faith is the courage to release the trapeze trusting that the Catcher will rescue us. Hope is the peace and assurance we experience as we soar untethered through the air knowing the Catcher will not let us fall. But once we are caught, once we are safely and fully in his grasp, faith and hope disappear. All that remains is the love between the Catcher and the caught. “Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.”16

The apostle John captured this moment in Revelation 2. Speaking to his people who were struggling and persecuted, Jesus promised to give them “a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it.”19 The meaning of this stone and the new name is rooted in ancient symbolism. It was customary in John’s day to use small tablets, often made of wood, stone, or metal, as a token of admission. It seems Jesus was offering those who overcome a ticket into his presence and the heavenly banquet.

Many people struggle with honesty in this practice. Very often we will think back to a conversation or event from the day and dwell on how we should have acted or what we ought to have said. The goal of the examen is not to reflect on what could, should, or ought to have happened, but rather to be honest with yourself, with the Holy Spirit’s help, about what did happen and how you actually felt. At times this will prompt confession of sin, but it is also an opportunity for self-examination and for God to reveal the truth about you.

As the fir-tree lifts up itself with a far different need from the need of the palm-tree, so does each man stand before God, and lift up a different humanity to the common Father. And for each God has a different response. With every man he has a secret—the secret of the new name. In every man there is a loneliness, an inner chamber of peculiar life into which God only can enter . . . a chamber into which no brother, nay, no sister can come. From this it follows that there is a chamber also—(O God, humble and accept my speech)—a chamber in God himself, into which none can enter but the one, the individual, the peculiar man—out of which chamber that man has to bring revelation and strength for his brethren. This is that for which he was made—to reveal the secret things of the Father.1

Each sunset is different, depending on where you stand. So when the voices in my head tell me I have nothing to offer, nothing interesting to say, I fight back with George MacDonald. Jesus said, “In my Father’s house are many rooms” (John 14:2). Could it be that those rooms are inner chambers in the heart of God, each of which has an individual’s name on it? If this is true, and I’d like to believe it is, then all I have to do is tell about my Lord and my God. Because I know him intimately, uniquely, it may be a revelation, in a sense, of the secret things of the Father. This is part of my calling—to make known the heart of God. And because he holds a special place in his heart for me and me alone (just as he holds a special place for you), my story stands a chance to be edifying to my sisters and brothers, just as your story, your insight, your revelation of God’s heart, is something the rest of us need.

I wonder if the Holy Spirit is rambling around in the temple of my heart, scribbling promises on every exposed bit of lumber, declaring my sacredness so that I will remember that I belong to him. And maybe when I’m old and I cross paths with some weary traveler, they’ll sense a rightness, a pleasantness of place, and will experience a peace that they cannot understand or explain.

We need not look anywhere but to the eyes of our Savior for our true identity, an identity which is profoundly complex, unfathomable, deep as the sea, and yet can be boiled down to one little word: beloved. That’s it. And that’s why it’s so silly (and perilous) to use your gifting to clothe yourself with meaning. Those clothes will never quite fit.

Here’s the point. If I had waited until the songs were finished, this thing might never have happened. If I had merely tinkered with these songs for all the years it took to finally record them, chances are I would have moved on to other things and never given it a try. It wouldn’t have grown into what it was meant to be. You can think and plan and think some more, but none of that is half as important as doing something, however imperfect or incomplete it is. Intention trumps execution, remember? Sometimes you book the tour before the songs are written. Sometimes you stand at the altar and say “I do” without any clue how you and your wife are going to make it. Sometimes you move to Nashville with no money in the bank and no real prospects. Sometimes you start with nothing and hope it all works out. Not sometimes—every time. All you really have is your willingness to fail, coupled with the mountain of evidence that the Maker has never left nor forsaken you.

But that morning when I was nineteen on the hillside in East Tennessee, things were different. Life itself—the one I was actually living—for once outshone the life I had yearned for. The Maker of this beautiful, broken world ambushed me. He had lain in wait for the perfect moment to spring: the perfect song at the perfect hour of the day, the contrition of my hungry heart, the intricate staging of the beauty that had led me to that dewy lawn, and his holy, brooding spirit draped over the valley like a mist. “Drink,” he told me, “and thirst no more.” I’m not saying this was my actual conversion, but it was a salient moment that perhaps marked the end of a season of struggle. When the shadows cast by my disappointment and self-hatred were banished by the light of the forgiveness, the acceptance, and the infinite affection of Christ, I could see the world around me for the miracle it was. I could see myself as a miracle.

Agenda is bad when it usurps the beauty. Christian art should strive for a marriage of the two, just as Christ is described as being “full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). Truth without beauty can be a weapon; beauty without truth can be spineless. The two together are like lyric and melody. This is not to say that beauty itself isn’t a kind of truth, nor that truth itself isn’t beautiful. It’ll take a better philosopher than me to parse all that out. (I commend to you authors like Steve Guthrie and Jeremy Begbie if you want to swim in those deep but lovely waters.)

This is why the Enemy wants you to think you have no song to write, no story to tell, no painting to paint. He wants to quiet you. So sing. Let the Word by which the Creator made you fill your imagination, guide your pen, lead you from note to note until a melody is strung together like a glimmering constellation in the clear sky. Love the Lord your God, and love your neighbor, too, by making worlds and works of beauty that blanket the earth like flowers. Let your homesickness keep you always from spiritual slumber. Remember that it is in the fellowship of saints, of friends and family, that your gift will grow best, and will find its best expression. And until the Kingdom comes in its fullness, bend your will to the joyful, tearful telling of its coming. Write about that. Write about that, and never stop.

And that evening, walking in the Judean heat, the gravity of Jesus’ love hit me all over again. That’s what Jesus means by “love one another.” It’s a love that feels — deep, raw, and true emotions.

The closing line is an interpolation in the original language. It’s almost like God’s voice cuts into the story. It’s the Creator’s way of saying, “Listen up. Pay attention. This marriage is a paradigm for all marriages.” It’s not a one-off. It’s a template for all marriages to follow. Think about it. Adam didn’t have a father or mother to leave. And Eve didn’t have any other options. But the story is written in such a way as to make the reader slow down and take notice. This story is ground zero for a theology of marriage.

In the wedding ceremony God says, “They become one flesh.” That word one is echad in Hebrew. It’s a graphic, weighty word. When you combine it with the word flesh, it basically means “fused together at the deepest levels.” And the exact same word is used for God. The ancient Hebrews had a prayer called the Shema that was the epicenter of Israel’s faith — “Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is echad.”4 God is fused together at the deepest levels. And in marriage we catch glimpses, hints, shadows of that kind of oneness.

When people don’t find life in God, they start to look for it elsewhere, and family is a natural place to start. Kids become gods. Parenting becomes tantamount to a religion.

What you and I call “the creative process,” theologians call “sanctification.” Don’t get scared off by the technical jargon. To be sanctified means “to be set apart” from the ugly, distorted human you used to be and remade into the real you. Get that. The real you. To God, your identity — what makes you you — isn’t rooted in the past (who you were) or in the present (who you are), but in the future — in who you are becoming.5

In theology this is called “eschatological realism,” which is a way of saying you are in the process of becoming who you really are. You are “holy,” and you are in the process of becoming holy. You are “pure,” and you are in the process of becoming pure. You are “blameless” (or without defect), and you are in the process of becoming blameless.

Like millions upon millions of other Americans, I married for happiness. That sounds innocuous at first glance. Heck, it sounds romantic. But the trouble is that happiness is the result of a healthy marriage. It’s not the reason for marriage. Happiness is a great thing, but it’s the by-product, the afterclap of marriage. It’s not the point.

Our whole mind-set on happiness is deeply flawed. “I deserve to be happy.” Really? I’m not sure that’s right. All of life is a gift from the Creator God. We think we have the right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” But contrary to what the American propaganda machine says, happiness is not a right. It’s a gift. God doesn’t owe you anything. And neither does your spouse. It’s all a gift.

And all of that is true. But the problem is that the Scriptures don’t start with a negative command about sex — “Don’t.” They start with a positive command — “Be fruitful and increase in number.” One of the first things we read about Adam and Eve is that they “were both naked, and they felt no shame.” Can you imagine sex with no guilt or shame? Nothing to hide? Just pure, unadulterated joy between a man and a woman, locked into relationship for life. That is what God created.

We don’t think this way anymore — at least not in the Western church. We have been deeply shaped by dualism. That’s the idea that the “spiritual world” (whatever that means) is good and the “physical world” is evil. But because we live in the physical world, dualism causes us to carry around a heaping dose of guilt. Every time we experience tov, we feel a twinge of shame. As if we’re not supposed to get pleasure from the world but must just endure it and wait for an escape to a place called “heaven,” which is very far away from the world we inhabit now. That’s not what the Scriptures teach, but many of us think this way.

Sex is no exception. In Romans, Paul writes, “God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator.”17 Paul’s first example of idolatry is sex. That’s telling.

When sex is your god, you have to download porn. You have to jack off. You have to sleep with your boyfriend. You have to let him touch you. You have to give into your body’s cravings, even if you know it’s going to steal from your future. You have no choice because you’re a slave. We like to define freedom as the ability to do whatever we want, whenever we want, with whomever we want. But to Jesus, that’s not freedom — that’s slavery! Freedom, at least in Jesus’ mind, is the ability to do whatever you should. To enjoy the world as God intended. To live fully awake and alive.

But God says sex is so much more! It’s two separate, autonomous human beings fused into one. It’s the melding of two bodies and two souls. It’s physical and spiritual, because there’s no way to bifurcate the two. That’s why there’s no such thing as casual sex, because sex involves all of you.

Let’s take another look at holiness, because it has a lot to do with how we come at sex. The word holy is qodesh in Hebrew. At the heart of its meaning is the concept of “dedicated to.” The root idea is “special, unique, different from the norm.” The opposite of holy isn’t evil. It’s ordinary, common, go with the crowd.

That’s how we need to understand holiness — as stepping into a marriage with God. On my wedding day, the pastor asked me, “Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?” And I spoke two words that changed my life forever. “I do.” In that moment, did any of the guests think I was a killjoy because I had just turned down love with other women? Or because I had just made a promise to love her even when I didn’t feel like it? Of course not. My wife is a stunning human being on so many levels. I’d like to think every single guy there was jealous. I was saying no to all sorts of freedoms, but I was saying yes to Tammy. The same is true for holiness. We have to say no to all sorts of things, but we do so in order to say yes to life with God.

We’ve come a long way from John Wesley and the horse tour. If anything, we’re living in a global move away from holiness. There’s a massive overreaction to legalism in the church right now, and the pendulum is swinging with a vengeance.

We want to make not sinning about self-control. In the moment of temptation, we clamp down our jaw, make a fist, and say no. And that’s fine. But really it’s about faith more than anything. It’s about giving up control, and trusting God. Who do you believe? The serpent or God? What do you trust? Your own moral compass or God’s wisdom?

To the Shulammite, the question isn’t “how far can we go?” but “when can we start?” Her advice is simple and worth following. Don’t wake up the sexual part of your relationship until you can follow it all the way through. That means don’t go anywhere near the line until your wedding day.

The point of the proverb is that before you build your house, there’s stuff you need to get done. Set in order. I think ideally you should have the trajectory set for your life.

David says, “Just wait. Life isn’t over yet.” But waiting is hard to do. That’s why David’s call is to “wait patiently” for the Lord.2 Not for a man or a woman. Not for a proposal or a “yes.” Not for a ring wrapped around your finger, but for God. And don’t forget that God is with you, right now. You’re not solitary. You’re not alone. God is at your side through every En Gedi, every broken engagement, every rejection, every disappointment. He’s there. You see, we’re not just waiting for God. We’re waiting with God. Waiting is active, not passive. Notice the language. Trust, do good, dwell, enjoy, take delight in, commit, be still — seven staccato commands all leading up to “wait patiently” for the Lord. Each one is dripping with implications.

What a great line. Notice it’s a command — take delight in God. And when you take delight in God, when you look to him for satisfaction, fulfillment, meaning, purpose, identity, validation — all the things you look for in love or a marriage or a career or a dream — your desires change. You think you’re craving romance, but really you’re craving God. You think you’re dying to get married, but really it’s God who is underneath your desires. You think you’re waiting for _______ (you fill in the blank here), but really you’re waiting for God. This isn’t a formula to manipulate God into giving you what you want. It’s not saying that if you delight in God, then he will come through for you. No. This is about desire replacement. When you chase after God, more than any other thing, you will find that your desires for what you don’t have, what you’re waiting for, are replaced by the pleasure of what you do have, in God. When all of your heart is wrapped up in him, your desires change.

It’s interesting that Paul says twice as much to the husbands as to the wives. The wives get three verses, and the husbands get nine. Why? Because the men are the leaders. God holds the men responsible to lead a healthy marriage. To God, authority is about responsibility, not bossing people around. Think of Adam and Eve in Genesis 3. Eve is the first one to take a bite from the fruit of the tree, but Adam is the first one to get in trouble. God says, “Where are you?” — as if to say, “What have you done?”5 God holds Adam responsible.

A friend of mine said no to dating an amazing girl because he wanted to live in the developing world for a few years. He’s an engineer, and he took a job with a nonprofit, building wells in Mozambique. For three years he lived on the back of a motorcycle, traveling from village to village. At night he would camp in the bush, and then each day he would show people how to get clean water. It was an amazing experience, but it would have been really hard to do with a wife and family. He made a smart decision to do that as a single person in order to follow God’s call.8 If you have this gift, even if you just have it for a while, then don’t waste time pining after romance.

The writer of Hebrews tells us he was “tempted in every way, just as we are — yet he did not sin.”15 When Jesus saw a beautiful woman (or man) pass by, he was just as tempted to turn around and lust after her as I am.

But unlike me, he never did. Not once. And Jesus was anything but “oppressed.” He was the freest human being to ever live.

But that’s not always the case. If you follow Jesus, you may find your sexual preference start to change and revert to what God intended, or you may struggle to curb your sexual desires for the rest of your life.22 I know men and women like this who have chosen celibacy to follow Jesus. It’s not easy for them, but they are thriving. You may never get married. You may live single for a long time. This isn’t just true of sexual preference. A lot of people have to fight the temptation to alcohol or porn or gossip or worry for decades, but they make it through. In fact, they live rich, meaningful lives. You may struggle, but you can struggle well.

In Jesus’ day, the cross wasn’t a religious cliché. It was a violent, barbaric symbol of death. It was an instrument of torture. Jesus is saying we all have stuff we have to “deny.” We have to die to certain things if we want to follow him.

We usually make one of two mistakes in love — and this applies to life as well. Some of us under-desire marriage (or a career or success or a dream), and so we settle. And we’re damned to mediocrity. The torture of the mundane. We never really live. We’re too scared or too cynical or just too tired to actually dream. We are the “realists,” but we all know that’s just code for pessimists in denial. We’re rarely let down because we aren’t brave enough to risk.

It’s not just a garden — it’s a gardenlike city. It’s not just Adam and Eve — it’s “persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.”12 And it’s not just marriage between a man and a woman — it’s all of humanity united in relationship with God forever.

As I see it, lust is when we look at a woman (or a man) for the purpose of desire. Dallas Willard says it’s when “we desire to desire.”1 It’s when we indulge, play with, mull on, tantalize, fantasize, and play with desire. When a woman or a man is an object for our imagination to play out sexual fantasy. Lust is selfish. It starts and ends with me. Attraction, on the other hand, is when we find a woman or a man beautiful because we see them as created in God’s image. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying the beauty of another human being, but, for men in particular, it’s a slippery slope from “enjoying the beauty” to lust. In his talk on the hill, Jesus calls his followers to a life free from lust.2 It can be achieved through the empowering presence of Jesus’ Spirit.

Well, it depends. Are your missions contradictory or complementary? If they are contradictory, then, yes, that’s a problem, and a serious one at that. If one of you can’t do what you know God has called you to do, then you should break up. The whole point of marriage is to partner together for God’s calling on your life. You should marry someone who will at least help you do that, not hold you back.

It is important to understand that biblically, sex is a whole-person bonding activity between a husband and wife to increase and deepen marital friendship and intimacy. The American view that it is a recreational activity between consenting adults is totally unacceptable. Really sacrilege — turning God’s beautiful gift into a commodity.

Question: What’s the Bible’s take on practicing safe sex? John Mark: Um, it’s called marriage. Just to clarify, any and all sex outside of marriage between a man and a woman is sin. There is no such thing as safe sex outside of marriage. You may not get pregnant if you use a condom or birth control, but you tear echad, and nobody is immune to that pain.

Question: Is it lust to get aroused by doing something that isn’t sex, like kissing? John Mark: It’s natural to get aroused by kissing or even by sight. Just looking at my wife in a summer dress does that for me, and we’ve been married for a decade. That’s how God created our bodies to work. Gerry: They key is, as soon as you get aroused, you need to stop — kissing, looking, cuddling, whatever. Better yet, know when you get aroused ahead of time, and avoid it. Remember The Song says three times, “Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.”8 Don’t activate that part of your relationship until you can follow it all the way to the end.

Religion, as the default mode of our thinking and practices, is based upon performance: “I obey; therefore, I am accepted by God.” The basic operating principle of the gospel, however, is, not surprisingly, an about-face, one of unmerited acceptance: “I am accepted by God through Christ; therefore, I obey.” To truly understand this paradigm shift at a life-altering level requires that the gospel be explored and “looked into” at every opportunity and in regular, systematic ways.

Love for God is commanded in Scripture, but the command can only truly be fulfilled as our eyes are opened to see God’s beauty revealed in the gospel. The Spirit of God uses the beauty of the gospel to awaken in our hearts a desire for God. “We love Him,” the apostle John would say, “because He first loved us” (1 John 4:19 nkjv). Love for God grows out of an experience of the love of God.

Let’s face it: Paul’s list here is impressive by anyone’s standard. “Speaking with the tongues of men and angels” has to put you in the top 1 percent of spiritually gifted people. “Understanding all mysteries and all knowledge” means that you’ve got even the finer points of Christian doctrine down pat. “Faith to remove mountains” means you can flat get stuff done in prayer. And “giving away even your body to be burned”? Wow. Obedience doesn’t get any more “radical” than that. When the offering plate goes by, you pull out a match and light yourself on fire for God. That’s Varsity. Yet, Paul says, spiritual giftedness, doctrinal mastery, audacious faith, and radical obedience do not equal the only thing that actually matters to God—love for Him. Without love even the most radical devotion to God is of no value to Him.

Maybe you are disturbed at how few of the fruits of the Spirit are present in your life. Do you ever think, How could anyone who is truly saved be as messed up as I am? I think that sometimes. When I look into my heart I still see a frustratingly small amount of generosity displaced by an overwhelming amount of selfishness. Jealously and pride still pop up like weeds. When I start to base my spiritual identity on how much progress I have made, I start to despair. My identity and my security are not in my spiritual progress. My identity and my security are in God’s acceptance of me given as a gift in Christ. And that’s good, because if anything, I am more, not less, aware of my sin than I was ten years ago. Get this: That is spiritual progress. To grow in awareness of the depths of sin God has saved you from is growth in the gospel. Do you worry a lot? Worry springs from not being convinced of a sovereign God’s absolute love for you. Worry disappears when you realize that God loves you unfailingly and will let nothing interrupt His plans for your good.

the way Zacchaeus informs Jesus of what he’s about to do. He’s not like, “Oh Sovereign Lord, in humble response to Your requirement, I give what Thou demands. Please accept my humble offerings in due recompense for the wicked things I have done.” The tone of Zack’s language is, instead, rather kid-like. Almost, “Look, Dad, watch . . . look at what I’m doing! Look, Dad, no hands!”

For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people . . . who are zealous for good works. (Titus 2:11–14) That’s a pretty exhaustive list of righteous living, isn’t it? “Renouncing ungodliness and worldly passions”; “living self-controlled, upright and godly lives”; “waiting” eagerly for Jesus to return . . . But how does Paul say we develop these things? What is it that trains us to do them? Bible memorization? Accountability partners? Being baptized in the Spirit? Radical devotion? Not that they don’t have their place, but Paul points to none of those here: It is “the grace of God,”

I imagine that when Jesus was telling this story, at this point His hearers rolled their eyes. “Give me a break. Nobody forgiven of millions of dollars would throw someone in prison over $3.” And that is Jesus’ point exactly. There is no way you could have any concept of what God has forgiven you of and be ungenerous in spirit toward others. If you are, it must mean you are unaware of the grace God as shown toward you.

“When you really believe the gospel, you see that you are first a sinner and only secondarily sinned against.

He said that Paul was indeed telling the truth in saying that because in his perception, he was the biggest sinner. Paul was better acquainted with his own sinfulness than he was anyone else’s. Of course Paul knew, theoretically, that other people were every bit the sinner he was, but he was so much more aware of his sin than he was theirs. When Paul thought about a need for grace, he didn’t think of others first—he thought of himself.

How can any of us who have tasted the extravagant love of Christ be stingy with our resources? Doesn’t His compassion toward us make us naturally disposed to help those in need? If we see someone who has a need that we can meet, how can our heart not want to help them? Won’t we love the fatherless, and the widow, and the shut-in, and the homeless, since we know that we once were fatherless, estranged from the Father, disabled, and headed for eternal separation from God?

In Nehemiah 8, when the people were wondering how to express their gratitude for “rediscovering” the law, their first response was to weep. But Ezra and Nehemiah corrected the people, and said, instead, “Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength” (8:10 niv). God wanted them to express their gratefulness in this case through a lavish party. Couldn’t they have just gnawed on corn husks and vegetables and drank water and given the rest of their money to the poor? Of course. But at this moment God wanted them to party.

Matthew 13:58 is one of the saddest verses in the New Testament. It says that Jesus did not do many mighty works in Nazareth “because of their unbelief.” It was not that Jesus was unwilling or unable to work there, it was that there was no one to believe Him and thereby release His power. I never want that to be said of my city, my church, or my family. I am confident this book has found its way into the hands of someone whose school or city God wants to turn upside down. Or maybe God is stirring your heart to go to one of the 6,600 unreached people groups. Maybe you will believe in God’s compassion for that group, and through your faith their salvation will become reality. Maybe you are the first believer in your family, and God will use your faith to bring the rest of your family to Him. Wherever you are, expect great things from God, and then attempt great things for Him.4

Let me be blunt: The prosperity gospel is a lie. God does love to give gifts to His children, and He delights in our successes. But the greatest prosperity is not driving a new car; it is knowing Him and having a life that brings glory to Him. Preaching a message that says if you come to Jesus, He will make you rich is not only wrong, it leads people to idolatry rather than faith. It leads people to use Jesus, not love Him.

The laws of God are like railroad tracks, pointing us in the direction to go. Trains need tracks to run on. But those tracks do nothing to power the engine.1 Similarly, laws, in themselves, are unable to give us the power to do them. The gospel is the power of God for salvation. Jerry Bridges sums it up well, God’s love provides us with the motivation for obedience, while God’s laws provide the direction for the biblical expressions of love.2

Legalism, for example, is thinking that reading the Bible makes God love and accept you more. It does not. Christ kept the law perfectly for me, and reading the Bible for four hours every morning would not make God look any more favorably upon me. Legalism is also thinking that forcing myself to read the Bible is sufficient, in and of itself, to generate in my heart a love for God and His Word. Reading the Bible can’t do that either; only the Spirit of God does that through the message of the gospel. Reading the Bible does, however, provide an opportunity for the Spirit to confront me with the message. As Paul Miller says, “Reading the Bible doesn’t create intimacy with God, but it does make room for it.”4

Salvation is not primarily about us doing something for God. Salvation is about knowing what God has done for us—and sitting in stunned awe of it. This is pivotal for us to remember as we consider the right way to work for God.

Salvation is not primarily about us doing something for God. Salvation is about knowing what God has done for us—and sitting in stunned awe of it. This is pivotal for us to remember as we consider the right way to work for God. Yes, in Christianity we will do things for God. But what we do will be a grateful response to what He’s done for us, not because He needs our help.

What should stand out about us as people look at us is the grace and power of Christ that exudes from our lives. Christian witness is primarily a testimony about God’s work on our behalf, not about our work on His.

When we put those first two principles together, we arrive at the third: gospel-centered people offer themselves to God, joyfully, and then do whatever He directs them to do, knowing that only what He empowers them to do will do any real good. That’s what we are responsible for—offering all we have to God and asking for His direction. That’s exactly what David did.

God has given us our local churches to help direct us in effectively meeting the spiritual and physical needs of our city. If your church doesn’t have a ministry to its city, go to a new one.

Here’s where it gets really exciting. It’s one thing for an individual to have a reawakening to the greatness of the gospel. It takes it to another level for an entire church to experience something like this. Can you imagine the kind of witness hundreds of people living gospel-centered lives together in a local church might have in a community? Can you fathom the kind of mercy and grace that would exude from their fellowship, and the kind of impact they would have when they began to be to their community as Jesus was to them? And what it looks like when an entire church of people begins to sense God’s willingness and ability to save their community, and ask accordingly? I get excited just writing that.

We are to be always, everywhere, preaching the word. That’s what the early church did. Everywhere, from house to house, they were always telling the story of Jesus.

Tim Keller has said, “Religion tells you to go and change; the gospel changes you on the spot.” Action steps that do not flow out of adoration of Jesus and gratefulness for what He’s done will ultimately produce only frustrated, prideful Pharisees, no matter how winsomely those action steps are presented.

At many “Reformed” churches, the particulars of Reformed theology overshadow the cross. The assumption seems to be that if you can master the particulars of the TULIP,2 and are devoted to 1, 2, and 3 John (John Calvin, John Piper, and John MacArthur), then you are spiritually acceptable and everything will be right in your life. Right doctrine is, of course, essential, but no “doctrinal flower” can transform your heart. Only the beauty of Jesus transforms the heart.

In Acts 6, the apostles were presented with a legitimate social need in their community—the widows needed someone to help put food on their tables. The apostles responded that others would have to see to this concern because they could not be distracted from preaching, their most important task (Acts 6:1–5).

Can’t you hear people during that time say, “What good is preaching if people among us are starving and suffering? The time for preaching is over and the time for action is here.” However, the Apostles, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, saw the dangerous temptation put in front of them and said, “Nothing can eclipse the importance of preaching the Word. We’ll ask God to help us raise up others who can meet those needs. We cannot, by any means, quit preaching.”

gospel-centered church prioritizes the message of the gospel in its ministries; focuses that message on what Christ has done rather than anything we are to be doing, and then demonstrates the gospel in the community around them.

There is really no distinction, you see, between what believers need to hear and what unbelievers need to hear. Both believers and unbelievers need to get a glimpse of God’s majestic glory, a taste of His surpassing beauty, and a sense of how much grace God has shown toward them in Christ.

He does a massive yard sale and borrows money from whoever will lend it. He gives up literally everything. But Jesus describes the man’s attitude toward this whole affair with one word: “joy.” In his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. (13:44)

may not be saved. “Lovelessness,” “apathy,” and “habitual sin” are diagnoses of spiritual death. We go desperately wrong, however, when we think we can fix those things by correcting our behavior. Faith in the gospel is always God’s prognosis.

One of my fears in writing this book is that it might contribute to a growing self-righteousness among younger theologians who feel like understanding gospel-centeredness makes them more special in the eyes of God (oh, the irony!) than those who can’t articulate it, and who judge everyone else by whether or not they use the same terms that they do.
