Similarly, there is an eerie correlation between meanness and how absolutely certain a person is about their beliefs. I’m not advocating agnosticism, but humility is in short supply among those seeking to perfectly demarcate truth and error, righteousness and wickedness, as they pursue a life under God.

Failure to engage the whole drama of Scripture, including the opening and closing scenes, may partially explain why we have little vision for a LIFE WITH GOD. But we must also recognize that we live neither in the garden of Eden nor in the New Jerusalem. Our lives, and all recorded history, exist between these two paradises. And while the scenes in Genesis and Revelation show a world of beauty, order, and life-giving abundance, such things are difficult to find in our experience.

Evil runs through each human heart. Therefore, if we remove religion, that particular motivation for conflict may be gone, but people will surely find some other reason to fight and kill each other. Enslavement to sin is no less real in secular societies than in religious ones.

I’ve heard pastors quip that B-I-B-L-E stands for “Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth,” and others have called it the “owner’s manual” for a human being. We may chuckle at these cute metaphors for the Bible, but behind them is a very un-Christian understanding of God and ironically an unbiblical one rooted in Enlightenment thinking.

Through it we discover who he is—and what greater gift can there be? And it does contain many useful and applicable principles for life and faith. But in our zeal to honor the importance of God’s Word and extol its usefulness, we may unintentionally do the opposite. We may reduce the Bible from God’s revelation of himself to merely a revelation of divine principles for life.

This is the third great failure of the LIFE OVER GOD approach—it causes us to gauge success based on effective outcomes rather than faithfulness to God’s calling. While studies may be able to tell us which principles of life, business, and ministry work, a research method has not yet been created that can determine whether a principle is right. In many places we simply assume that God values effectiveness as much as we do.

This may help explain why we have more religious resources, books, radio and television stations, ministries, and schools than ever before, and yet more people are leaving the church.29 Maybe they’ve discovered what they really wanted from God can be achieved just as easily without him. Or perhaps they’ve gotten what they can from him and have left home for a metaphorical distant country.

At the H.O.D., drinking functioned as an alternative code of ethics—one that valued authenticity more than sobriety. And most of the students had not abandoned their faith in Christ; they were just looking for something more robust and real than institutional Christianity. Those who had given up on the search sometimes soothed their pain with more potent devices—usually drugs or sex.

“I don’t drink because I like the alcohol,” one female student told me. “In fact, I usually don’t drink at all. I just hold the beer in my hand.” “Then why take the risk of being caught and disciplined?” I asked. “Because drinking is how you know who’s safe. When you drink with another student, you know that you can trust them. You’ve both broken the code of ethics—it’s a sign that you can be honest about other things too. They’re a safe person—you don’t have to pretend with them.”

You’ve been taught the Bible from the time you could crawl, and you attend Christian colleges, but not one of you gave the right answer.

This is the first failure of LIFE FOR GOD—it puts God’s mission ahead of God himself. Paul, the most celebrated missionary in history, did not make this mistake. He understood that his calling (to be a messenger to the Gentiles) was not the same as his treasure (to be united with Christ). His communion with Christ rooted and preceded his work for him.

LIFE FOR GOD takes our fear of insignificance and throws gasoline on it. The resulting fire may be presented to the world as a godly ambition, a holy desire to see God’s mission advance—the kind of drive evident in the apostle Paul’s life. But when these flames are fueled by fear, they reveal none of the peace, joy, or love displayed by Paul. The relentless drive to prove our worth can quickly become destructive.

While the sons were fixated on their father’s wealth, the father was fixated on his sons. This is what they failed to understand, and it is what LIFE FROM GOD and FOR GOD fail to grasp. God’s gifts are a blessing and his work is important, but neither can nor should replace God as our focus.

A great deal of effort is expended in faith communities trying to transform people from younger sons into older sons. But this is a fool’s errand, because what mattered most to the father was neither the younger son’s disobedience nor the older son’s obedience, but having his sons with him.
