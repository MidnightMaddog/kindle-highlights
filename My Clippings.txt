Failure to engage the whole drama of Scripture, including the opening and closing scenes, may partially explain why we have little vision for a LIFE WITH GOD. But we must also recognize that we live neither in the garden of Eden nor in the New Jerusalem. Our lives, and all recorded history, exist between these two paradises. And while the scenes in Genesis and Revelation show a world of beauty, order, and life-giving abundance, such things are difficult to find in our experience.

This is the third great failure of the LIFE OVER GOD approach—it causes us to gauge success based on effective outcomes rather than faithfulness to God’s calling. While studies may be able to tell us which principles of life, business, and ministry work, a research method has not yet been created that can determine whether a principle is right.

At the H.O.D., drinking functioned as an alternative code of ethics—one that valued authenticity more than sobriety.

LIFE FOR GOD takes our fear of insignificance and throws gasoline on it. The resulting fire may be presented to the world as a godly ambition, a holy desire to see God’s mission advance—the kind of drive evident in the apostle Paul’s life. But when these flames are fueled by fear, they reveal none of the peace, joy, or love displayed by Paul. The relentless drive to prove our worth can quickly become destructive.

J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings, often employed a storytelling device he called eucatastrophe. A catastrophe is an unexpected evil, but Tolkien added the Greek prefix eu- meaning “good” to express the unexpected appearing of goodness. He defined it as “the sudden happy turn in a story which pierces you with a joy that brings you to tears.” It has this effect on us “because it is a sudden glimpse of Truth” in which we “feel a sudden relief as if a major limb out of joint had suddenly snapped back.”

Faith is the opposite of seeking control. It is surrendering control. It embraces the truth that control is an illusion—we never had it and we never will. Rather than trying to overcome our fears by seeking more control, the solution offered by LIFE WITH GOD is precisely the opposite—we overcome fear by surrendering control. But surrender is only possible if we have total assurance that we are safe. We must be convinced that if we let go we will be caught. This assurance only comes when we trust that our heavenly Father desires to be with us and will not let us fall.

The comments continued along these lines for the remainder of the hour. Words like unrealistic, impossible, and foolish were frequently used to describe Jesus’ teaching. The class generally believed that anyone trying to live as Jesus taught would either be miserable because of their failure to do it, or as stupid as the sheep who went over the cliff. In a dangerous world, obeying the Sermon on the Mount was tantamount to suicide.

This is the shortcoming of seeking hope and meaning from external conformity to a religion—it fails to truly rehabilitate us. It does not bring real dignity and significance to a person unless he or she perfectly conforms to expectations. This may help explain why increasing numbers of people are either leaving the institutional church or feeling unaccepted within it. When their lives are marked by divorce, addiction, same-sex attraction, or something else deemed “unrighteous,” the dignity they long for is withheld.

In other words, the fullness of Christian life can be lived anywhere, in any circumstance, because God is with us. No condition of life is more honorable than another, because nothing God does lacks value. If he is with us in marriage or singleness, and in the garage, the office, or the home, then these very different lives are each significant. Each of them carries the same dignity and hope.

While Jacob was kneeling in the field to pray one day, Saunders came up to him and pointed a gun at his head. Saunders ordered him to stop praying and to get back to work. Jacob finished his prayer and then invited Saunders to pull the trigger. “Your loss will be my gain,” he said. “I have two masters—Master Jesus in heaven, and Master Saunders on earth. I have a soul and a body; the body belongs to you, but my soul belongs to Jesus.” Saunders was so shaken by Jacob’s strength and lack of fear that he never touched him again.23

Given her seemingly endless reservoir of love, it is not surprising to learn that Mother Antonia began each day at 5:00 a.m. with an hour of prayer and Scripture reading. The Bible illuminated a clear vision of God for her by driving away the shadows of the world that seek to hide and distort our view, and in silence she communed intimately with him. It was this time set apart for silence and solitude that filled her reservoir of love.

Why is it so important that you are with God and God alone. . . ? It’s important because it’s the place in which you can listen to the voice of the One who calls you the beloved. To pray is to listen to the One who calls you “my beloved daughter,” “my beloved son,” “my beloved child.” To pray is to let that voice speak to the center of your being, to your guts, and let that voice resound in your whole being.6

If we return to Nouwen’s trapeze analogy, we can see the transient nature of both faith and hope. Faith is the courage to release the trapeze trusting that the Catcher will rescue us. Hope is the peace and assurance we experience as we soar untethered through the air knowing the Catcher will not let us fall. But once we are caught, once we are safely and fully in his grasp, faith and hope disappear. All that remains is the love between the Catcher and the caught. “Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.”16

The apostle John captured this moment in Revelation 2. Speaking to his people who were struggling and persecuted, Jesus promised to give them “a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it.”19 The meaning of this stone and the new name is rooted in ancient symbolism. It was customary in John’s day to use small tablets, often made of wood, stone, or metal, as a token of admission. It seems Jesus was offering those who overcome a ticket into his presence and the heavenly banquet.

Many people struggle with honesty in this practice. Very often we will think back to a conversation or event from the day and dwell on how we should have acted or what we ought to have said. The goal of the examen is not to reflect on what could, should, or ought to have happened, but rather to be honest with yourself, with the Holy Spirit’s help, about what did happen and how you actually felt. At times this will prompt confession of sin, but it is also an opportunity for self-examination and for God to reveal the truth about you.

As the fir-tree lifts up itself with a far different need from the need of the palm-tree, so does each man stand before God, and lift up a different humanity to the common Father. And for each God has a different response. With every man he has a secret—the secret of the new name. In every man there is a loneliness, an inner chamber of peculiar life into which God only can enter . . . a chamber into which no brother, nay, no sister can come. From this it follows that there is a chamber also—(O God, humble and accept my speech)—a chamber in God himself, into which none can enter but the one, the individual, the peculiar man—out of which chamber that man has to bring revelation and strength for his brethren. This is that for which he was made—to reveal the secret things of the Father.1

Each sunset is different, depending on where you stand. So when the voices in my head tell me I have nothing to offer, nothing interesting to say, I fight back with George MacDonald. Jesus said, “In my Father’s house are many rooms” (John 14:2). Could it be that those rooms are inner chambers in the heart of God, each of which has an individual’s name on it? If this is true, and I’d like to believe it is, then all I have to do is tell about my Lord and my God. Because I know him intimately, uniquely, it may be a revelation, in a sense, of the secret things of the Father. This is part of my calling—to make known the heart of God. And because he holds a special place in his heart for me and me alone (just as he holds a special place for you), my story stands a chance to be edifying to my sisters and brothers, just as your story, your insight, your revelation of God’s heart, is something the rest of us need.

I wonder if the Holy Spirit is rambling around in the temple of my heart, scribbling promises on every exposed bit of lumber, declaring my sacredness so that I will remember that I belong to him. And maybe when I’m old and I cross paths with some weary traveler, they’ll sense a rightness, a pleasantness of place, and will experience a peace that they cannot understand or explain.

We need not look anywhere but to the eyes of our Savior for our true identity, an identity which is profoundly complex, unfathomable, deep as the sea, and yet can be boiled down to one little word: beloved. That’s it. And that’s why it’s so silly (and perilous) to use your gifting to clothe yourself with meaning. Those clothes will never quite fit.

Here’s the point. If I had waited until the songs were finished, this thing might never have happened. If I had merely tinkered with these songs for all the years it took to finally record them, chances are I would have moved on to other things and never given it a try. It wouldn’t have grown into what it was meant to be. You can think and plan and think some more, but none of that is half as important as doing something, however imperfect or incomplete it is. Intention trumps execution, remember? Sometimes you book the tour before the songs are written. Sometimes you stand at the altar and say “I do” without any clue how you and your wife are going to make it. Sometimes you move to Nashville with no money in the bank and no real prospects. Sometimes you start with nothing and hope it all works out. Not sometimes—every time. All you really have is your willingness to fail, coupled with the mountain of evidence that the Maker has never left nor forsaken you.

But that morning when I was nineteen on the hillside in East Tennessee, things were different. Life itself—the one I was actually living—for once outshone the life I had yearned for. The Maker of this beautiful, broken world ambushed me. He had lain in wait for the perfect moment to spring: the perfect song at the perfect hour of the day, the contrition of my hungry heart, the intricate staging of the beauty that had led me to that dewy lawn, and his holy, brooding spirit draped over the valley like a mist. “Drink,” he told me, “and thirst no more.” I’m not saying this was my actual conversion, but it was a salient moment that perhaps marked the end of a season of struggle. When the shadows cast by my disappointment and self-hatred were banished by the light of the forgiveness, the acceptance, and the infinite affection of Christ, I could see the world around me for the miracle it was. I could see myself as a miracle.

Agenda is bad when it usurps the beauty. Christian art should strive for a marriage of the two, just as Christ is described as being “full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). Truth without beauty can be a weapon; beauty without truth can be spineless. The two together are like lyric and melody. This is not to say that beauty itself isn’t a kind of truth, nor that truth itself isn’t beautiful. It’ll take a better philosopher than me to parse all that out. (I commend to you authors like Steve Guthrie and Jeremy Begbie if you want to swim in those deep but lovely waters.)

This is why the Enemy wants you to think you have no song to write, no story to tell, no painting to paint. He wants to quiet you. So sing. Let the Word by which the Creator made you fill your imagination, guide your pen, lead you from note to note until a melody is strung together like a glimmering constellation in the clear sky. Love the Lord your God, and love your neighbor, too, by making worlds and works of beauty that blanket the earth like flowers. Let your homesickness keep you always from spiritual slumber. Remember that it is in the fellowship of saints, of friends and family, that your gift will grow best, and will find its best expression. And until the Kingdom comes in its fullness, bend your will to the joyful, tearful telling of its coming. Write about that. Write about that, and never stop.

And that evening, walking in the Judean heat, the gravity of Jesus’ love hit me all over again. That’s what Jesus means by “love one another.” It’s a love that feels — deep, raw, and true emotions.

The closing line is an interpolation in the original language. It’s almost like God’s voice cuts into the story. It’s the Creator’s way of saying, “Listen up. Pay attention. This marriage is a paradigm for all marriages.” It’s not a one-off. It’s a template for all marriages to follow. Think about it. Adam didn’t have a father or mother to leave. And Eve didn’t have any other options. But the story is written in such a way as to make the reader slow down and take notice. This story is ground zero for a theology of marriage.

In the wedding ceremony God says, “They become one flesh.” That word one is echad in Hebrew. It’s a graphic, weighty word. When you combine it with the word flesh, it basically means “fused together at the deepest levels.” And the exact same word is used for God. The ancient Hebrews had a prayer called the Shema that was the epicenter of Israel’s faith — “Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is echad.”4 God is fused together at the deepest levels. And in marriage we catch glimpses, hints, shadows of that kind of oneness.

When people don’t find life in God, they start to look for it elsewhere, and family is a natural place to start. Kids become gods. Parenting becomes tantamount to a religion.

What you and I call “the creative process,” theologians call “sanctification.” Don’t get scared off by the technical jargon. To be sanctified means “to be set apart” from the ugly, distorted human you used to be and remade into the real you. Get that. The real you. To God, your identity — what makes you you — isn’t rooted in the past (who you were) or in the present (who you are), but in the future — in who you are becoming.5

In theology this is called “eschatological realism,” which is a way of saying you are in the process of becoming who you really are. You are “holy,” and you are in the process of becoming holy. You are “pure,” and you are in the process of becoming pure. You are “blameless” (or without defect), and you are in the process of becoming blameless.

Like millions upon millions of other Americans, I married for happiness. That sounds innocuous at first glance. Heck, it sounds romantic. But the trouble is that happiness is the result of a healthy marriage. It’s not the reason for marriage. Happiness is a great thing, but it’s the by-product, the afterclap of marriage. It’s not the point.

Our whole mind-set on happiness is deeply flawed. “I deserve to be happy.” Really? I’m not sure that’s right. All of life is a gift from the Creator God. We think we have the right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” But contrary to what the American propaganda machine says, happiness is not a right. It’s a gift. God doesn’t owe you anything. And neither does your spouse. It’s all a gift.

And all of that is true. But the problem is that the Scriptures don’t start with a negative command about sex — “Don’t.” They start with a positive command — “Be fruitful and increase in number.” One of the first things we read about Adam and Eve is that they “were both naked, and they felt no shame.” Can you imagine sex with no guilt or shame? Nothing to hide? Just pure, unadulterated joy between a man and a woman, locked into relationship for life. That is what God created.

We don’t think this way anymore — at least not in the Western church. We have been deeply shaped by dualism. That’s the idea that the “spiritual world” (whatever that means) is good and the “physical world” is evil. But because we live in the physical world, dualism causes us to carry around a heaping dose of guilt. Every time we experience tov, we feel a twinge of shame. As if we’re not supposed to get pleasure from the world but must just endure it and wait for an escape to a place called “heaven,” which is very far away from the world we inhabit now. That’s not what the Scriptures teach, but many of us think this way.

Sex is no exception. In Romans, Paul writes, “God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator.”17 Paul’s first example of idolatry is sex. That’s telling.

When sex is your god, you have to download porn. You have to jack off. You have to sleep with your boyfriend. You have to let him touch you. You have to give into your body’s cravings, even if you know it’s going to steal from your future. You have no choice because you’re a slave. We like to define freedom as the ability to do whatever we want, whenever we want, with whomever we want. But to Jesus, that’s not freedom — that’s slavery! Freedom, at least in Jesus’ mind, is the ability to do whatever you should. To enjoy the world as God intended. To live fully awake and alive.

But God says sex is so much more! It’s two separate, autonomous human beings fused into one. It’s the melding of two bodies and two souls. It’s physical and spiritual, because there’s no way to bifurcate the two. That’s why there’s no such thing as casual sex, because sex involves all of you.

Let’s take another look at holiness, because it has a lot to do with how we come at sex. The word holy is qodesh in Hebrew. At the heart of its meaning is the concept of “dedicated to.” The root idea is “special, unique, different from the norm.” The opposite of holy isn’t evil. It’s ordinary, common, go with the crowd.

That’s how we need to understand holiness — as stepping into a marriage with God. On my wedding day, the pastor asked me, “Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?” And I spoke two words that changed my life forever. “I do.” In that moment, did any of the guests think I was a killjoy because I had just turned down love with other women? Or because I had just made a promise to love her even when I didn’t feel like it? Of course not. My wife is a stunning human being on so many levels. I’d like to think every single guy there was jealous. I was saying no to all sorts of freedoms, but I was saying yes to Tammy. The same is true for holiness. We have to say no to all sorts of things, but we do so in order to say yes to life with God.

We’ve come a long way from John Wesley and the horse tour. If anything, we’re living in a global move away from holiness. There’s a massive overreaction to legalism in the church right now, and the pendulum is swinging with a vengeance.

We want to make not sinning about self-control. In the moment of temptation, we clamp down our jaw, make a fist, and say no. And that’s fine. But really it’s about faith more than anything. It’s about giving up control, and trusting God. Who do you believe? The serpent or God? What do you trust? Your own moral compass or God’s wisdom?

To the Shulammite, the question isn’t “how far can we go?” but “when can we start?” Her advice is simple and worth following. Don’t wake up the sexual part of your relationship until you can follow it all the way through. That means don’t go anywhere near the line until your wedding day.

The point of the proverb is that before you build your house, there’s stuff you need to get done. Set in order. I think ideally you should have the trajectory set for your life.

David says, “Just wait. Life isn’t over yet.” But waiting is hard to do. That’s why David’s call is to “wait patiently” for the Lord.2 Not for a man or a woman. Not for a proposal or a “yes.” Not for a ring wrapped around your finger, but for God. And don’t forget that God is with you, right now. You’re not solitary. You’re not alone. God is at your side through every En Gedi, every broken engagement, every rejection, every disappointment. He’s there. You see, we’re not just waiting for God. We’re waiting with God. Waiting is active, not passive. Notice the language. Trust, do good, dwell, enjoy, take delight in, commit, be still — seven staccato commands all leading up to “wait patiently” for the Lord. Each one is dripping with implications.

What a great line. Notice it’s a command — take delight in God. And when you take delight in God, when you look to him for satisfaction, fulfillment, meaning, purpose, identity, validation — all the things you look for in love or a marriage or a career or a dream — your desires change. You think you’re craving romance, but really you’re craving God. You think you’re dying to get married, but really it’s God who is underneath your desires. You think you’re waiting for _______ (you fill in the blank here), but really you’re waiting for God. This isn’t a formula to manipulate God into giving you what you want. It’s not saying that if you delight in God, then he will come through for you. No. This is about desire replacement. When you chase after God, more than any other thing, you will find that your desires for what you don’t have, what you’re waiting for, are replaced by the pleasure of what you do have, in God. When all of your heart is wrapped up in him, your desires change.

It’s interesting that Paul says twice as much to the husbands as to the wives. The wives get three verses, and the husbands get nine. Why? Because the men are the leaders. God holds the men responsible to lead a healthy marriage. To God, authority is about responsibility, not bossing people around. Think of Adam and Eve in Genesis 3. Eve is the first one to take a bite from the fruit of the tree, but Adam is the first one to get in trouble. God says, “Where are you?” — as if to say, “What have you done?”5 God holds Adam responsible.

A friend of mine said no to dating an amazing girl because he wanted to live in the developing world for a few years. He’s an engineer, and he took a job with a nonprofit, building wells in Mozambique. For three years he lived on the back of a motorcycle, traveling from village to village. At night he would camp in the bush, and then each day he would show people how to get clean water. It was an amazing experience, but it would have been really hard to do with a wife and family. He made a smart decision to do that as a single person in order to follow God’s call.8 If you have this gift, even if you just have it for a while, then don’t waste time pining after romance.

The writer of Hebrews tells us he was “tempted in every way, just as we are — yet he did not sin.”15 When Jesus saw a beautiful woman (or man) pass by, he was just as tempted to turn around and lust after her as I am.

But unlike me, he never did. Not once. And Jesus was anything but “oppressed.” He was the freest human being to ever live.

But that’s not always the case. If you follow Jesus, you may find your sexual preference start to change and revert to what God intended, or you may struggle to curb your sexual desires for the rest of your life.22 I know men and women like this who have chosen celibacy to follow Jesus. It’s not easy for them, but they are thriving. You may never get married. You may live single for a long time. This isn’t just true of sexual preference. A lot of people have to fight the temptation to alcohol or porn or gossip or worry for decades, but they make it through. In fact, they live rich, meaningful lives. You may struggle, but you can struggle well.

In Jesus’ day, the cross wasn’t a religious cliché. It was a violent, barbaric symbol of death. It was an instrument of torture. Jesus is saying we all have stuff we have to “deny.” We have to die to certain things if we want to follow him.

We usually make one of two mistakes in love — and this applies to life as well. Some of us under-desire marriage (or a career or success or a dream), and so we settle. And we’re damned to mediocrity. The torture of the mundane. We never really live. We’re too scared or too cynical or just too tired to actually dream. We are the “realists,” but we all know that’s just code for pessimists in denial. We’re rarely let down because we aren’t brave enough to risk.

It’s not just a garden — it’s a gardenlike city. It’s not just Adam and Eve — it’s “persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.”12 And it’s not just marriage between a man and a woman — it’s all of humanity united in relationship with God forever.

As I see it, lust is when we look at a woman (or a man) for the purpose of desire. Dallas Willard says it’s when “we desire to desire.”1 It’s when we indulge, play with, mull on, tantalize, fantasize, and play with desire. When a woman or a man is an object for our imagination to play out sexual fantasy. Lust is selfish. It starts and ends with me. Attraction, on the other hand, is when we find a woman or a man beautiful because we see them as created in God’s image. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying the beauty of another human being, but, for men in particular, it’s a slippery slope from “enjoying the beauty” to lust. In his talk on the hill, Jesus calls his followers to a life free from lust.2 It can be achieved through the empowering presence of Jesus’ Spirit.

Well, it depends. Are your missions contradictory or complementary? If they are contradictory, then, yes, that’s a problem, and a serious one at that. If one of you can’t do what you know God has called you to do, then you should break up. The whole point of marriage is to partner together for God’s calling on your life. You should marry someone who will at least help you do that, not hold you back.

It is important to understand that biblically, sex is a whole-person bonding activity between a husband and wife to increase and deepen marital friendship and intimacy. The American view that it is a recreational activity between consenting adults is totally unacceptable. Really sacrilege — turning God’s beautiful gift into a commodity.

Question: What’s the Bible’s take on practicing safe sex? John Mark: Um, it’s called marriage. Just to clarify, any and all sex outside of marriage between a man and a woman is sin. There is no such thing as safe sex outside of marriage. You may not get pregnant if you use a condom or birth control, but you tear echad, and nobody is immune to that pain.

Question: Is it lust to get aroused by doing something that isn’t sex, like kissing? John Mark: It’s natural to get aroused by kissing or even by sight. Just looking at my wife in a summer dress does that for me, and we’ve been married for a decade. That’s how God created our bodies to work. Gerry: They key is, as soon as you get aroused, you need to stop — kissing, looking, cuddling, whatever. Better yet, know when you get aroused ahead of time, and avoid it. Remember The Song says three times, “Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.”8 Don’t activate that part of your relationship until you can follow it all the way to the end.

Religion, as the default mode of our thinking and practices, is based upon performance: “I obey; therefore, I am accepted by God.” The basic operating principle of the gospel, however, is, not surprisingly, an about-face, one of unmerited acceptance: “I am accepted by God through Christ; therefore, I obey.” To truly understand this paradigm shift at a life-altering level requires that the gospel be explored and “looked into” at every opportunity and in regular, systematic ways.

Love for God is commanded in Scripture, but the command can only truly be fulfilled as our eyes are opened to see God’s beauty revealed in the gospel. The Spirit of God uses the beauty of the gospel to awaken in our hearts a desire for God. “We love Him,” the apostle John would say, “because He first loved us” (1 John 4:19 nkjv). Love for God grows out of an experience of the love of God.

Let’s face it: Paul’s list here is impressive by anyone’s standard. “Speaking with the tongues of men and angels” has to put you in the top 1 percent of spiritually gifted people. “Understanding all mysteries and all knowledge” means that you’ve got even the finer points of Christian doctrine down pat. “Faith to remove mountains” means you can flat get stuff done in prayer. And “giving away even your body to be burned”? Wow. Obedience doesn’t get any more “radical” than that. When the offering plate goes by, you pull out a match and light yourself on fire for God. That’s Varsity. Yet, Paul says, spiritual giftedness, doctrinal mastery, audacious faith, and radical obedience do not equal the only thing that actually matters to God—love for Him. Without love even the most radical devotion to God is of no value to Him.

Maybe you are disturbed at how few of the fruits of the Spirit are present in your life. Do you ever think, How could anyone who is truly saved be as messed up as I am? I think that sometimes. When I look into my heart I still see a frustratingly small amount of generosity displaced by an overwhelming amount of selfishness. Jealously and pride still pop up like weeds. When I start to base my spiritual identity on how much progress I have made, I start to despair. My identity and my security are not in my spiritual progress. My identity and my security are in God’s acceptance of me given as a gift in Christ. And that’s good, because if anything, I am more, not less, aware of my sin than I was ten years ago. Get this: That is spiritual progress. To grow in awareness of the depths of sin God has saved you from is growth in the gospel. Do you worry a lot? Worry springs from not being convinced of a sovereign God’s absolute love for you. Worry disappears when you realize that God loves you unfailingly and will let nothing interrupt His plans for your good.

the way Zacchaeus informs Jesus of what he’s about to do. He’s not like, “Oh Sovereign Lord, in humble response to Your requirement, I give what Thou demands. Please accept my humble offerings in due recompense for the wicked things I have done.” The tone of Zack’s language is, instead, rather kid-like. Almost, “Look, Dad, watch . . . look at what I’m doing! Look, Dad, no hands!”

For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people . . . who are zealous for good works. (Titus 2:11–14) That’s a pretty exhaustive list of righteous living, isn’t it? “Renouncing ungodliness and worldly passions”; “living self-controlled, upright and godly lives”; “waiting” eagerly for Jesus to return . . . But how does Paul say we develop these things? What is it that trains us to do them? Bible memorization? Accountability partners? Being baptized in the Spirit? Radical devotion? Not that they don’t have their place, but Paul points to none of those here: It is “the grace of God,”

I imagine that when Jesus was telling this story, at this point His hearers rolled their eyes. “Give me a break. Nobody forgiven of millions of dollars would throw someone in prison over $3.” And that is Jesus’ point exactly. There is no way you could have any concept of what God has forgiven you of and be ungenerous in spirit toward others. If you are, it must mean you are unaware of the grace God as shown toward you.

“When you really believe the gospel, you see that you are first a sinner and only secondarily sinned against.

He said that Paul was indeed telling the truth in saying that because in his perception, he was the biggest sinner. Paul was better acquainted with his own sinfulness than he was anyone else’s. Of course Paul knew, theoretically, that other people were every bit the sinner he was, but he was so much more aware of his sin than he was theirs. When Paul thought about a need for grace, he didn’t think of others first—he thought of himself.

How can any of us who have tasted the extravagant love of Christ be stingy with our resources? Doesn’t His compassion toward us make us naturally disposed to help those in need? If we see someone who has a need that we can meet, how can our heart not want to help them? Won’t we love the fatherless, and the widow, and the shut-in, and the homeless, since we know that we once were fatherless, estranged from the Father, disabled, and headed for eternal separation from God?

In Nehemiah 8, when the people were wondering how to express their gratitude for “rediscovering” the law, their first response was to weep. But Ezra and Nehemiah corrected the people, and said, instead, “Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength” (8:10 niv). God wanted them to express their gratefulness in this case through a lavish party. Couldn’t they have just gnawed on corn husks and vegetables and drank water and given the rest of their money to the poor? Of course. But at this moment God wanted them to party.

Matthew 13:58 is one of the saddest verses in the New Testament. It says that Jesus did not do many mighty works in Nazareth “because of their unbelief.” It was not that Jesus was unwilling or unable to work there, it was that there was no one to believe Him and thereby release His power. I never want that to be said of my city, my church, or my family. I am confident this book has found its way into the hands of someone whose school or city God wants to turn upside down. Or maybe God is stirring your heart to go to one of the 6,600 unreached people groups. Maybe you will believe in God’s compassion for that group, and through your faith their salvation will become reality. Maybe you are the first believer in your family, and God will use your faith to bring the rest of your family to Him. Wherever you are, expect great things from God, and then attempt great things for Him.4

Let me be blunt: The prosperity gospel is a lie. God does love to give gifts to His children, and He delights in our successes. But the greatest prosperity is not driving a new car; it is knowing Him and having a life that brings glory to Him. Preaching a message that says if you come to Jesus, He will make you rich is not only wrong, it leads people to idolatry rather than faith. It leads people to use Jesus, not love Him.

The laws of God are like railroad tracks, pointing us in the direction to go. Trains need tracks to run on. But those tracks do nothing to power the engine.1 Similarly, laws, in themselves, are unable to give us the power to do them. The gospel is the power of God for salvation. Jerry Bridges sums it up well, God’s love provides us with the motivation for obedience, while God’s laws provide the direction for the biblical expressions of love.2

Legalism, for example, is thinking that reading the Bible makes God love and accept you more. It does not. Christ kept the law perfectly for me, and reading the Bible for four hours every morning would not make God look any more favorably upon me. Legalism is also thinking that forcing myself to read the Bible is sufficient, in and of itself, to generate in my heart a love for God and His Word. Reading the Bible can’t do that either; only the Spirit of God does that through the message of the gospel. Reading the Bible does, however, provide an opportunity for the Spirit to confront me with the message. As Paul Miller says, “Reading the Bible doesn’t create intimacy with God, but it does make room for it.”4

Salvation is not primarily about us doing something for God. Salvation is about knowing what God has done for us—and sitting in stunned awe of it. This is pivotal for us to remember as we consider the right way to work for God. Yes, in Christianity we will do things for God. But what we do will be a grateful response to what He’s done for us, not because He needs our help.

When we put those first two principles together, we arrive at the third: gospel-centered people offer themselves to God, joyfully, and then do whatever He directs them to do, knowing that only what He empowers them to do will do any real good. That’s what we are responsible for—offering all we have to God and asking for His direction. That’s exactly what David did.

Here’s where it gets really exciting. It’s one thing for an individual to have a reawakening to the greatness of the gospel. It takes it to another level for an entire church to experience something like this. Can you imagine the kind of witness hundreds of people living gospel-centered lives together in a local church might have in a community? Can you fathom the kind of mercy and grace that would exude from their fellowship, and the kind of impact they would have when they began to be to their community as Jesus was to them? And what it looks like when an entire church of people begins to sense God’s willingness and ability to save their community, and ask accordingly? I get excited just writing that.

At many “Reformed” churches, the particulars of Reformed theology overshadow the cross. The assumption seems to be that if you can master the particulars of the TULIP,2 and are devoted to 1, 2, and 3 John (John Calvin, John Piper, and John MacArthur), then you are spiritually acceptable and everything will be right in your life. Right doctrine is, of course, essential, but no “doctrinal flower” can transform your heart. Only the beauty of Jesus transforms the heart.

Can’t you hear people during that time say, “What good is preaching if people among us are starving and suffering? The time for preaching is over and the time for action is here.” However, the Apostles, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, saw the dangerous temptation put in front of them and said, “Nothing can eclipse the importance of preaching the Word. We’ll ask God to help us raise up others who can meet those needs. We cannot, by any means, quit preaching.”

When we believe truth—that is, ideas that correspond to reality—we show up to reality in such a way that we flourish and thrive. We show up to our bodies, to our sexuality, to our interpersonal relationships, and, above all, to God himself in a way that is congruent with the Creator’s wisdom and good intentions for his creation. As a result, we tend to be happy. But when we believe lies—ideas that are not congruent with the reality of God’s wise and loving design—and then, tragically, open our bodies to those lies and let them into our muscle memories, we allow an ideological cancer to infect our souls. We live at odds with reality, and as a result we struggle to thrive.

And while it’s easy to laugh this story off—“I would never fall for the old talking snake routine”—the more sophisticated the person or culture, the more fine-tuned the devil’s tactics. Again, he’s far more intelligent than we give him credit for. Crafty is the word used in Genesis 3. But his tactic is the same basic formula on repeat: Isolate, then lie. Pick a lie that plays to a disordered desire. Get your mark to take a relational step away from God and to redefine good and evil for himself. Done. This is still how the devil plies his craft. As a pastor, I could tell you countless stories of people who have walked into sin or even walked away from God, and it always starts with drifting away from community with other solid followers of Jesus.

Within the scope of the larger story the Scriptures tell, Jesus comes as a second Adam, the one, true human being who comes to do what Adam was supposed to do all along but failed: face down the devil but not give in. Remember, Adam means “human.” Like Adam, Jesus is tempted; unlike Adam, he is victorious over temptation. Instead of a garden, he’s in a desert, symbolic of humanity’s exile from the garden due to sin. Instead of eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he’s fasting, feeding on the Spirit for power to defeat the devil’s ploy. The devil starts in on Jesus the same way he did on Eve, by planting doubts in Jesus’s mind about his identity as the object of God’s love: “If you are the Son of God.”12 In the story literally right before, God said to Jesus, “You are my Son, whom I love.”13 For the erudite reader, it’s the snake’s update of “Did God really say?” The devil’s threefold temptation is subtle, clever, and manipulative and has nothing to do with getting Jesus to sin as we think of it. It plays instead to the undercurrents of desire in Jesus’s heart. The desire to take his kingdom by an easier way. To get the right thing, the wrong way.

A lot of people misunderstand silence and solitude (another name for this practice) as a place to relax and recharge. A kind of emotional break for introverts to catch their breath before they return to the fray of life. But that is not the solitude of Jesus or the apostle Paul or Evagrius of Pontus. For them, it wasn’t a break from the battle; it was the field on which the battle was won or lost.

You fight the devil’s lies by simply choosing to not think about them. But as we all know, you can’t think about nothing. So you give your mind something else to think about: Scripture. You replace the devil’s lies with God’s truth. You cut new neural pathways that eventually take root in the neurobiology of your body itself. You become what you give your mind to.

Doctrine does matter—very much—but not to “pass the test” and get into heaven. It matters because we become like our vision of God. The goal of reading Scripture is not information but spiritual formation. To take on the “mind of Christ.”22 To actually think like Jesus thinks. To fill your mind with the thoughts of God so regularly and deeply that it literally rewires your brain, and from there, your whole person.

our strongest desires are not actually our deepest desires. What I mean by that is, in the moment of temptation, the raging fire of desire that is your flesh—the desire to make a condescending comment about your coworker, buy another pair of shoes you don’t need, overeat, overdrink, lust, ignore God, watch Netflix instead of reading your Bible—feels overwhelming and almost irresistible.

For the Scripture writers, anything that has control over you—be it an autocratic tyrant, a slave owner, a self-defeating behavior, or an addiction to drugs or alcohol or even your phone—is your master. This is why the Hebrew wisdom literature includes sayings about how the wicked are “trapped by evil desires.”16 It’s why New Testament theologians portrayed our pre-Jesus life as one where we were “foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures.”

For all the talk about the danger of tyranny from the Right or illiberalism from the Left or the rising specter of China’s digital censorship, most of that is fear mongering and a red herring.

This is also why the founders of our nation envisioned America as a republic, not technically as a democracy. True democracy has been tried at least twice before, in ancient Greece and Rome. In both attempts, it degenerated into mob rule and from there into tyranny. Anxious to avoid a repeat of history, Edmund Burke laid out the logic behind the American architecture in a letter from 1791: Men are qualified for civil liberty, in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites [read: flesh]…. Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.21

Willpower versus a second cookie is one thing. But willpower versus triggered trauma? Or willpower versus addiction? Or willpower versus a father wound? It doesn’t stand a chance. As long as a temptation is just interfacing with the prefrontal cortex, willpower is a great resource to draw on. But the moment we’re dealing with the amygdala, with the part of the brain or soul that is deeply wounded or hardwired in sinful ways of being, we are outmanned and outgunned by the flesh. If you’re trying to use willpower against your self-defeating behavior that’s rooted in trauma or past pain and you feel like you’re failing, don’t beat yourself up; change your strategy. Willpower is not the answer to your problem.

Now, just to make sure we’re clear, your body is not evil. This is where the medieval monastic movement got it wildly wrong. Your body is a gift, as is pleasure in the right time and place and way. But your body, like the rest of your soul, has been corrupted by sin. As a result, your body often works against you in your fight with the flesh, via your sex drive, fight-or-flight system, or survival instincts. Fasting is a way to turn your body into an ally in your fight with the flesh rather than an adversary. If you don’t believe me, just try it. See what happens.

Everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.31 His word choice of lust is telling. Lust is perverted love; it’s desire turned in on itself. John warned against three lusts of the world: “The lust of the flesh”—clearly, he had in mind sexual temptation, the epitome of love deformed, where an image bearer we were made to give sacrificial love to becomes an object of desire we take pleasure from, even if it’s consensual. But this includes more than just sexual desire; it’s any desire of our flesh—for food, drink, instant gratification, control, domination over others, and on down the list. “The lust of the eyes”—clearly, greed was in John’s crosshairs, but also envy, jealousy, discontentment, and the “cancerous restlessness” of our age.32 Finally, “the pride of life”—the human bent in all of us to go our own way, rebel against authority, and think we know better than our forebears. “Who are you to tell me?” is the anthem of project self. These are the three great temptations Jesus himself faced in the desert. The language is different, but the devil’s offer was the same. Think about it… “The lust of the flesh”—the temptation to turn stones into bread, to give in to his body’s desire for gastrointestinal satisfaction and his flesh’s craving for pleasure. “The lust of the eyes”—the temptation to bow down and worship the devil and in turn receive “all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor”;33 to have it all, desire with no boundaries. And “the pride of life”—the temptation to throw himself down from the high point of the temple and, in doing so, to receive the glory and awe of humankind; to turn his life into a spectacle, to become a celebrity. You see the parallels? These are the three paradigmatic temptations of the world. And they are very, very old. New Testament scholars point out that both John and the gospel writer Matthew alluded to the garden temptation in Genesis 3. Remember the language? When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.34 Can you see how the three line up? “The lust of the flesh” = “good for food” = stones to bread “The lust of the eyes” = “pleasing to the eye” = the kingdoms and their splendor “The pride of life” = “desirable for gaining wisdom” = the temple spectacle

In a world of “you do you” and “keep your laws off my body” and “don’t tread on me,” we must choose—of our own free will—to live under the authority of the New Testament charter, as best exemplified by the Sermon on the Mount, and we must do so together. In deep, vulnerable, interdependent relationships that stand in sharp relief to the superficiality and autonomy of our day. Think of the inviolable honesty and intimacy of Alcoholics Anonymous, not the posturing of the golf club; think of the confession of sin, not chitchat; think of the trust within relationships formed over decades, not the fast-burning social connections of like-attracts-like.

I’ll pay my taxes, go grocery shopping, and have my neighbors over for dinner. I’ll volunteer with my kids to serve the houseless. I’ll make my small, nondramatic contribution to the peace and prosperity of the city I call home. And I’ll fight the three enemies that prowl the city’s streets. I’ll stand with the beautiful resistance. I’ll live, and if I must, I’ll die—in hope. But I won’t do it alone.

After all, the vast majority of our lives is spent working. By working I don’t just mean our job or career. Work is way more than what we get paid for. It’s cooking dinner, cleaning your apartment, washing the car, exercise, running errands — the stuff of everyday life. And the next largest slice of the pie chart is spent resting. By resting I don’t just mean the ancient ritual of Sabbath, although we’ll get into that in depth. I mean sleeping, your day off, time on the couch with a good novel or movie, brunch with your friends, vacation — the stuff we look forward to and savor. The moments when we wish life had a Pause button.

“For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!”23 This is an unexpected twist. Paul’s basic idea is that because of Adam’s disobedience, we all die, but because of Jesus’ obedience, we all live. But in this statement, he takes it to the next level. Not only do we live, but we “reign in life.” Whoa . . . slow this down. “Reign” is king language. It’s Genesis language. “Reign” is what we were supposed to do all along, before Adam mucked it all up. Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. God’s original intent was always for a human being to rule over the world.24

Let’s drill down on two ideas here: work it and take care of it. The first word is abad in Hebrew, and it basically means work. But that’s not the only way it’s translated into English. Sometimes it’s translated “service.” So work is service. Service to God. Service to people made in his image — which is everybody. And, I would argue, service to the earth itself. But abad is also the same word used all over the Hebrew Bible for worship. Interesting. So work and worship aren’t two separate ideas. They are connected at the hip. They are two translations of the same word.5 It’s tragic that we think of worship as a few songs at church every Sunday. That is worship — of course. But in a Genesis-shaped worldview — all of life is worship.

When you think of Eden, don’t think of a public park with a lawn, a play set, and a flowerbed or two, where God hands Adam a lawnmower and says, Keep it tidy, will ya? Think of a violent, untamed wilderness teeming with beauty, but no infrastructure, no roads, no bridges, no cities, no civilization, and God says, Go make a world. Adam wasn’t a landscape-maintenance employee. He was an explorer, a cartographer, a gardener, a designer, an architect, a builder, an urban planner, a city-maker.

I mean, you would think that if Jesus’ agenda is to fix the world gone awry, then the story would end up back where it all started — in Eden, with everybody naked and unashamed. But instead, it’s a little different. Actually, it’s a lot different. It’s a Garden-like city called New Jerusalem with walls and gates and streets and dwellings and art and architecture and food and drink and music and culture. Why is that? Because the Garden was never supposed to stay a garden; it was always supposed to become a garden city.

And all of Paul’s language builds up to this staggering line: “For we are God’s coworkers.”12 This is a provocative metaphor. Most of us think of ourselves as God’s employees, not his coworkers. As if we’re working for God. And there’s some truth in that. Paul loves to call himself God’s servant. But if we’re God’s coworkers, that means we’re not only working for God, we’re also working with God.

This is where the Scriptures’ teaching on manual labor is so ahead of its time. Paul tells the Thessalonians to “mind your own business and work with your hands.”5 In the ancient Mediterranean, manual labor was looked down on. Digging ditches for the sewer, paving roads for the city, cooking food for the family — this kind of work was done by slaves and servants and the working poor. Historians argue that the Bible is one of the only ancient documents to hold up blue-collar work as an honorable way of life.

If they start a business, it has to have an ichthus in the logo, or at least on the business card. And that’s not all bad. Some of it’s really inspiring. But if all of us lived this way, well, it could get really unhealthy . . . We could end up in a world where the church is a kind of cultural ghetto — a relic from the past, where we used to be known for stunning art and genre-bending architecture and pushing the edge of science and rethinking economic theory, but now we’re known for really bad music and cheesy design and parody T-shirts and an odd tribal dialect that nobody else really understands — and the world would just kind of move on without us — maybe even mock us or laugh us off as stupid and then start to shape a totally different kind of culture without us . . .

God doesn’t do cheap, low-grade, half-baked work. He’s not lazy. He doesn’t make junk. He has a value for excellence and artistry and quality of materials and design. And it’s not because he is a perfectionist. Although, I guess he is perfection . . . It’s because he is love.

We can’t find happiness or satisfaction or whatever it is that we’re searching for in work or in rest, apart from God. That’s the bad news. Here’s the good news. What if God set it up this way? What if this was all God’s idea? What if he’s up to something? After all, he was the one who cursed the ground. We sinned, true, but he cursed the ground. Why would he do that? Why would a loving, generous Creator curse his own creation? Is he cruel? Sadistic? Psychopathic? Just plain mean? Here’s my theory; I think the curse is a blessing in camouflage. It’s God’s love in disguise. His mercy incognito.14 Because the curse drives us to God. If it weren’t for the curses — on both the family and the field — we would look to whatever it is we do for work or rest, and we would find it. And nothing could be more disastrous for the world than God’s image bearers finding identity and belonging and even satisfaction apart from him. Thankfully, that will never happen.

In fact, what if our work — even the hard, difficult, frustrating parts of it — are one of, if not the primary context where God does his work of salvation? By salvation I don’t just mean the transition “out of hell and into heaven.” Hopefully you know by now that’s just the beginning. I mean Jesus remaking us into the people we were supposed to be all along — kings and queens over the world. To get us ready for what’s coming.

As I said earlier in the book, the creation story starts with God working and ends with God resting. After six “days” of world making, it’s done. The universe is “completed.” And you think your week was productive? Then we read that God rested. Make sure you catch that. God rested. God, who doesn’t need sleep or a day off or a vacation, who doesn’t get tired or worn down or grouchy, who is without parallel to any other being in the universe, rested.

Jews have been practicing the art of Sabbath for millennia. We have a lot we can learn from them. They talk a lot about menuha — another Hebrew word that’s translated “rest,” but it’s a very specific kind of rest. It’s not just a nap on the couch. It’s a restfulness that’s also a celebration. It’s often translated “happiness.” And to the Jews, menuha is something you create. It’s not just that you stop working and sit on the couch for a day every week. It’s about cultivating an environment, an atmosphere to enjoy your life, your world, and your God. It’s more of a mode of being than a twenty-four-hour time slot.

The rabbis make a big deal about the “principle of first mention,” which, put simply, means the first time you read a word in the Scriptures it’s kind of like a definition. It sets the stage for how you read the word all the way through. Did you know that the first time you read the word qadosh in the Bible is right here? And what does God make holy? Time. This is intriguing. You would think that after creating the world, God would make a holy space— a mountain or a temple or a shrine. After all, every other religion has a holy space. Islam has Mecca. Hinduism has the Ganges River. Paganism has Stonehenge. Baseball has Wrigley Field. But this God doesn’t have a holy space; he has a holy time —the Sabbath. This God isn’t found in the world of space — in a temple, on top of a mountain, at a spring, around a statue or a monument. He’s found in the world of time.

The Sabbath is like that. It’s a day where your goal is to savor every second. Because it’s holy. Is this how you think of holiness? Sadly, a lot of us think of holiness in the negative — about what we don’t do. We don’t get drunk or we don’t sleep around or we don’t watch R-rated movies (unless they are about Jesus or have Russell Crowe in them). And that’s not all bad, but it’s one-sided. Holiness also has a positive side. It’s about what we do.

But in Deuteronomy it ends like this: “Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.”4 This is a new twist. Here, nothing is said about creation. Instead, the Sabbath command is grounded in the story of the exodus. At Sinai, the Sabbath is an art form. It’s about tapping into the rhythm of creation; in Deuteronomy, the Sabbath is an act of defiance against Pharaoh and his slave drivers. At Sinai it’s a way of saying yes to God and his world; in Deuteronomy it’s a way of saying no to Egypt and its system. At Sinai it’s an invitation to join God in his delight; in Deuteronomy it’s a warning to stay away from Egypt’s way of life.

This is why Moses is calling Israel to remember that they were slaves in Egypt. What an odd command, right? Slaves don’t forget they were slaves any more than vets from Iraq forget they went through hell. The African American slave trade was more than two centuries ago, but it’s still fresh in our minds, an open wound in our culture. And it should be. It was horrific. The command isn’t just to remember they were slaves, but to remember they were slaves. As in, they aren’t anymore. That, sadly, is easy to forget.

Food, drink, a place to call home, clothing to wear, a car to drive — these are not bad things. But the problem is that we always want more of them.

Lots of people misread Jesus here. We read all these stories where Jesus is fighting with the Pharisees over the Sabbath, and it’s easy to think Jesus is down on the Sabbath. As if the Sabbath is legalistic, or it’s part of the Law. But keep in mind that the Sabbath predates the Law by thousands of years. It’s more of a rhythm in creation than a rule in a book. The reality is the Sabbath is un-American, inconvenient, and we want an excuse to write it off.

During the renewal of contemplative spirituality in the 1960s and 1970s, many Western Christians turned to Eastern methods like Zen meditation to nurture their spirituality. This shift grieved Father Thomas Keating, a Trappist monk from the Cistercian order, who saw curious pilgrims bypass his own Benedictine monastery, oblivious to the fact that the Christian tradition held helpful contemplative practices itself. Consequently, he worked to make Centering Prayer accessible to all, giving a time-honored contemplative practice back to the laity.

When they lose themselves and start to bump around the bottom of life, not getting their way by imposing unrealistic standards, Ones disintegrate toward the Four. In disintegration, Ones believe their own lie that they alone are the only ones who understand and value excellence—that no one else has the capacity to grasp what is required for goodness to be actualized in the world.

These painful moments of clarity came in the quietness of spiritual practice when I was no longer distracting myself from the harmful lies I had come to believe about my identity. When I actually took time to stop—ceasing the fight for justice, which was frequently a proxy war for the inner work I was refusing to focus on—I finally began to learn to be present, to listen, and to practice much-needed restraint.

But what happens when gut people simply stop? Who are they without the good they do? When an instinctive type is forced to stop, they realize how overidentified they are with their drive to do. They are not free.

A contemplative approach to the Enneagram invites us to resist the reductionism of inner fragmentation; to realize we aren’t as bad as our worst moments or as good as our greatest successes—but that we are far better than we can imagine and carry the potential to be far worse than we fear.

Now, with a certainty which never after deserted him, he saw the planets—the “earths” he called them in his thought—as mere holes or gaps in the living heaven—excluded and rejected wastes of heavy matter and murky air, formed not by addition to, but by subtraction from, the surrounding brightness. And yet, he thought, beyond the solar system the brightness ends. Is that the real void, the real death? Unless . . . he groped for the idea . . . unless visible light is also a hole or gap, a mere diminution of something else. Something that is to bright unchanging heaven as heaven is to the dark, heavy earths. . .

It was also assumed that all creation pointed to God’s sustaining presence. It was a sacramental way of seeing the world. Over the course of the last six hundred years a gradual but profound conceptual shift occurred in the West. We became secular in our orientation. In other words, from a secular perspective God no longer sustains the universe. And even if there is a God who created all (whether by immediate declaration or mediated evolution), that God is “way over there” and the world is “way over here” with a life of its own.

Two primitive instincts are in service of the infant’s attachment design. First is the sucking instinct. It fosters a bond with the mother whereby the child absorbs both the physical and emotional needs of the young soul. Second is the instinctual search for the gaze of another’s eyes. Looking for and locking on to the eyes of another also fosters a bond. These instincts build the neural network that compels the infant’s connection with others.

I (Rich) remember vividly when my first daughter, Jennifer, left for college. I was excited for her but knew our family system would in some significant ways be changed forever. And within a week I felt depressed. Six months later I was still seriously sad. At that point it began to dawn on me that Jennifer’s leaving had triggered a deeper loss, one I had suffered twenty years earlier. It was the loss of my mother when I was twenty-four years old. Since her death I had been busy finishing seminary, planting a church and trying to figure out how to be a competent pastor. It left little time for grieving, and consequently I had ignored significant parts of what I had lived.

If we long for more soulful relationships, if we truly desire to be more fully present to our spouse, our children, our friends and even to God, then we must be more present to our story. Ignoring our story conscripts us into the service of our earliest emotional blueprints and the defenses we forged in order to feel safe. Exaggerated defenses force us to live in the shallow end of the relational pool. Remembering our story, entering our story, probing our story is the way by which we own and integrate ourselves.

Whatever your story is, our conviction is this—you are held by God, and God is always listening with a loving ear. God cares about your story because God cares about you. God hears and delights in your joy. God also hears the cry of your heart. Sharing your story with God does not mean painful, shameful memories will magically disappear. But God “gets” your story. He is a suffering God. And because he has suffered in the Son, our trinitarian God offers you a way to his heart through your suffering. In your pain God’s sorrow holds you, comforts you and over time heals you.

Confidence in the truth, goodness and beauty of God and each other made loving submission a natural and fulfilling reality. Then God’s love for them came into question. The serpent said God is not good and thus not trustworthy. As a result Adam and Eve lost faith in their Creator. They decided to do life on their own, ignoring the fact that their capacity for pure, loving relationships depended on their trust of God. (Remember, permeable souls need a loving presence to mimic if they are to become and grow in the capacity to love well.) The consequences of their mistrust were devastating. They discovered their nakedness and clothed themselves with leaves. They hid from their Creator, who longed to commune with them in the cool of the evening. They blamed each other for their transgression. Their mistrust expressed in self-reliance and self-determination birthed shame, fear and guilt. These inhibiting emotions, once exaggerated, would disrupt and damage their ability to engage in soulful relationships with God and each other.

Obviously, the events and emotions of our past are what they are. Many are good. Many are bad. But whether good or bad we cannot change them. They are what they are. I (Jim) cannot change the fact that I didn’t pursue a career in aviation even though I absolutely loved airplanes as a kid and got my pilot license when I was sixteen. The only thing that can change in our story is the third factor of a story: its interpretation.

By then Joseph had the power to destroy his brothers. But he said to them, “What you meant for evil, God intended for good.” This was not minimizing life’s evils with a glib one-liner. Instead it captured the words of wisdom that stand at the heart of all true-self living. They are proof that Joseph’s story was reinterpreted to such an extent that he became lovingly receptive toward the family members who had betrayed him and caused such pain and loneliness.

Joseph didn’t come up with an idea that changed his story. His experience of God reconfigured his identity and his way of looking at the world. The reinterpreted story of Joseph flowed from his experience with God. His life was recalibrated in terms of how he saw his world (specifically, his family). His story was no longer primarily configured around the beatings and suffering he endured at the hands of greedy and envious brothers. His story was now formed by his faith in God.

We encourage you to use as many tools as you find helpful in order to know what is happening deep within yourself. We feel strongly about this because in all our years of ministry we have never known a single person whose relationships suffered because of lack of doctrinal facts. Not one! But there are many stories of collapsed ministries, estranged marriages, distant children, failed friendships and coworker conflict because people had little self-understanding. The blindness that emerges from a lack of knowing what is going on in our souls is truly devastating.

A healthy community finds ways to point to the mystery of God indwelling the church, as well as the mystery of who we are as the body of Christ. It points us to the miraculous mystery of the Holy Spirit, who dwells within the people of God (1 Corinthians 3:16). It teaches us how to respect mystery through the sacraments of baptism and Lord’s Supper. It honors mystery in and through its liturgy.

Community exposes us. In particular, it reveals our “inward bent.” To put it even more bluntly, any experience of community will, over time, make our self-centered grandiosity quite clear. In community our demand that life take shape on our terms eventually comes out. In community our insistence that others be what we need and want them to be is sooner or later exposed.

Character is not embracing moral platitudes or virtuous ways of acting. Jesus isn’t interested in his church putting on virtues as if wearing a garment. His concern is that we are formed internally in such a way that we are literally structured in and by certain virtues. His goal for us is that we become moral persons from the inside out, not simply that we do virtuous things.

To put it another way, soulful relationships are a gift that requires our intentionality. We know this to be true. A strong marriage and a solid family is the fruit of someone being intentional. Someone has made certain choices and has practiced certain skills like waiting, listening, clearly expressing needs and desires, storytelling, patience, repentance and a good dose of self-knowledge.

The one who loves more sees more. (Love is a form of knowledge.) As we respond with a prayer for understanding, God begins to show us what has been acting below the surface of our souls. As we see this we surrender our false self into the loving hand of God. In this way God works to reform and transform our souls so that our unhealthy defenses and attachment patterns, our exaggerated responses and false-self strategies progressively give way to our true self in Christ.

It may seem strange but doing the will of God is a different matter than just doing what God wants us to do. The two are so far removed, in fact, that we can be solidly in the will of God, and know that we are, without knowing God’s preference with regard to various details of our lives.

When our children, John and Becky, were small, they were often completely in my will as they played happily in the back garden, though I had no preference that they should do the particular things they were doing there or even that they should be in the back garden instead of playing in their rooms or having a snack in the kitchen. Generally we are in God’s will whenever we are leading the kind of life he wants for us. And that leaves a lot of room for initiative on our part, which is essential: our individual initiatives are central to his will for us.

live in an ongoing conversation with God, speaking and being spoken to. During the time I spent writing this book, I made a special point of drawing others out in conversation concerning their experiences of hearing God. When they sensed a spirit of acceptance and understood the topic is to be dealt with seriously, then their stories began to flow. And as understanding and confidence grew, other cases came to mind that they saw to be or to contain a word from God to the individual. Many might be surprised to discover what a high percentage of serious Christians—and even non-Christians—can tell of specific experiences in which they are sure God spoke to them. Of course, talking to God is an almost universal practice. The words “Talking to God: An Intimate Look at the Way We Pray” covered the front of Newsweek’s issue for January 6, 1992. The main article was devoted to some sociological studies of the practice of prayer undertaken in the United States. “This week,” the article said, “more of us will pray than will go to work, or exercise, or have sexual relations. . . . 78 percent of all Americans pray at least once a week; more than half (57 percent) report praying at least once a day. . . . Even among the 13 percent of Americans who are atheists or agnostics, nearly one in five still prays daily.”

On one sabbath Jesus came upon a man with a withered hand in the synagogue (Mk 3:1-5). He called him out and asked the people gathered around whether one should do good on the sabbath (heal the man) or do evil (leave him in distress). Their silence declared loudly and eloquently their condition. They did not know what God would want or what to do! “They were silent” (v. 4). After he had healed the man, however, they thought it right to make plans to kill Jesus. This was only another destructive fruit of the same hearts that could wonder whether or not the man should be healed. But Jesus knew what God wanted done in this case because he knew the mind of God generally. On another occasion when he was denounced for healing on the sabbath he calmly replied, “My Father is still working, and I also am working” (Jn 5:17).

God does indeed guide us in many ways, by special acts of intervention in our lives as well as by general providential ordering of the world. But his direct communication with us, by word and by shared activity, is the most important part. This is because we are to become the temple of God, one that actively understands and cooperates with God’s purposes, one that is inhabited through a willing, clear-eyed identification of ourselves with Jesus Christ.

When our lives are devoted to the will of God, he has reason to speak to us. If our lives are not devoted to his purposes, he may still speak to us and even use us for his purposes if we are strategically placed. After all, we are his creatures, no matter how misguided or rebellious. But for a willing walk in conscious, loving cooperation with God, we must come to grips with the issue What are we living for? We must face it clearly.

In the still, small voice of God we are given a message that bears the stamp of his personality quite clearly and in a way we will learn to recognize. But, in contrast with other cases, the medium through which the message comes is diminished almost to the vanishing point, taking the form of thoughts that are our thoughts, though these thoughts are not from us. In this way, as we shall see, the human spirit becomes the “candle of the LORD” (Prov

In Moses’ encounter with God through the burning bush, Moses’ last line of protest against the assignment that God was giving him was that he didn’t speak well: “O my Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor even now that you have spoken to your servant; but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue” (Ex 4:10). The Lord’s reply was that he, after all, had made human mouths and presumably could assist them to accomplish his assignments: “Now go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you are to speak” (Ex 4:12).

Moses and Paul, two of the people most responsible for the human authorship of the Bible, were, accordingly, weak with words so that they might have the best chance of clinging constantly to their support in God, who spoke in union with them, and so that they might unerringly connect their hearers with God.

Few things are more terrifying in the spiritual arena than those who absolutely know but who are also unloving, hostile, proud, superstitious and fearful. That Aaron and Miriam could be jealous of Moses is a sure indication that God could not trust them with the kind of knowledge he shared freely with Moses. That Moses was untroubled by their attack and glad to share the prophetic ministry just as surely indicates that he could be trusted with such knowledge.

What is life? In all its various levels and types, life is power to act and respond in specific kinds of relations. For example, a cabbage has certain powers of action and response and a corresponding level of life. There is a big difference between a cabbage that is alive and one that is dead, though the dead one still exists. This can also be said of a snail or a kitten. But a live cabbage can make no response to, say, a ball of string. That is precisely because of the kind of life that is in it. Though alive as a cabbage, it is dead to the realm of play. Similarly, a kitten playing with the string can make no response to numbers or poetry, and in that sense the kitten is dead to the realms of arithmetic and literature. A live cabbage, though dead to one realm (that of play) is yet alive in another—that of the soil, the sun and the rain. The situation is similar with the kitten. Human

Human beings “born of water” (Jn 3:5)—that is, through natural birth—are alive in the flesh, in the biological and psychological realm of nature. But in relation to God they remain “dead through the trespasses and sins” (Eph 2:1). Therefore they inhabit a world “without hope and without God” (Eph 2:12 NIV). They can, however, be born a second time, “born from above” (Jn 3:3). This is not merely to be born again in the sense of repeating something or to make a new start from the same place. Instead, it is a matter of an additional kind of birth, whereby we become aware of and enter into the spiritual kingdom of God. Imagine an otherwise normal kitten that suddenly begins to appreciate and compose poetry, and that image will give you an impression of the huge transition involved in this additional birth.

Once, in the middle of the Sea of Galilee, the disciples’ boat was almost beaten under by the waves while Jesus slept calmly. His disciples woke him crying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” (Mt 8:25). Jesus reproachfully replied, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” (Mt 8:26). Now the disciples obviously had great faith in Jesus. They called upon him, counting on him to save them. They had great faith in him, but they did not have his great faith in God. It was because they did not have his faith that he spoke of how little faith they had.

It may help to remember these words of Thomas à Kempis: Of what use is it to discourse learnedly on the Trinity, if you lack humility and therefore displease the Trinity? Lofty words do not make a man just or holy; but a good life makes him dear to God. I would far rather feel contrition than be able to define it.

In my own experience, I first became aware that it was God’s word that was coming to me by the effects it had on myself and others around me. My main work for God is that of a teacher. I have occasionally received insights that, while perhaps of little significance in themselves, were experienced by me as literally staggering. Then, as I became aware and began to trust that these insights were God’s word, I immediately began to observe the qualitative difference that Wesley emphasizes. And I began to find that certain others also understood, from their experience, exactly what this difference was. Adela Rogers St. John remarks (perhaps somewhat overconfidently but yet to the point), “The first time you receive guidance you will know the difference. You can mistake rhinestones for diamonds, but you can never mistake a diamond for a rhinestone.”

There are reasons other than his displeasure why a specific word may not be forthcoming to us in a particular case. One of the major other reasons is that, in general, it is God’s will that we ourselves should have a great part in determining our path through life. This does not mean that he is not with us. Far from it. God both develops and, for our good, tests our character by leaving us to decide.

It will come without threat to the full participation of the redeemed self, as a unique individual, in the work of God. For those who come to this point, their life will be theirs—irreducibly, preciously so—and yet also God’s, and through them will flow God’s life, which is also theirs.

I do preach to as many as desire to hear, every night and morning. You ask, what I would do with them: I would make them virtuous and happy, easy in themselves and useful to others. Whither would I lead them? To heaven; to God the Judge, the lover of all, and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant. What religion do I preach? The religion of love; the law of kindness brought to light by the gospel. What is this good for? To make all who receive it enjoy God and themselves: to make them all like God; lovers of all; contented in their lives; and crying out at their death, in calm assurance, “O grave, where is thy victory! Thanks be unto God, who giveth me the victory, through my Lord Jesus Christ.”10

John Wesley answered an intelligent and serious man who said to him, “I hear that you preach to a great number of people every night and morning. Pray what would you do with them? Whither would you lead them? What religion do you preach? What is it good for?” Honest and searching questions, which no minister should allow out of his mind. Wesley replied, I do preach to as many as desire to hear, every night and morning. You ask, what I would do with them: I would make them virtuous and happy, easy in themselves and useful to others. Whither would I lead them? To heaven; to God the Judge, the lover of all, and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant. What religion do I preach?

It was said of the prodigal son that he came to himself (Lk 15:17) and then he found the truth and repentance that saved him from his plight. When God came to Adam after he had sinned, he did not ask, “Adam, where is God?” but “Adam, where are you?” (Gen 3:9). We must purposefully, humbly and intelligently cultivate the ability to listen and see what is happening in our own souls and to recognize therein the movements of God.

We are hindered in our progress toward becoming spiritually competent people by how easily we can explain away the movements of God toward us. They go meekly, without much protest. Of course God’s day will come, but for now he cooperates with the desires and inclinations that make up our character, as we gradually become the kind of people we will forever be.

The ordinary love pretends too much. The real love is nonpretentious; it simply is. The ordinary love becomes almost sickening, syrupy, drippy, what you call “lovey-dovey.” It is sickening, it is nauseating. The real love is a nourishment, it strengthens your soul. The ordinary love only feeds your ego—not the real you but the unreal you. The unreal always feeds the unreal, remember; and the real feeds the real.

If I have to choose between the words love and God, I will choose love; I will forget all about God, because those who know love are bound to know God. But it is not vice versa: Those who think about God and philosophize about God may never know about love—and will never know about God, either.

Love knows nothing of duty. Duty is a burden, a formality. Love is a joy, a sharing; love is informal. The lover never feels that he has done enough; the lover always feels that more was possible. The lover never feels, “I have obliged the other.” On the contrary, he feels, “Because my love has been received, I am obliged. The other has obliged me by receiving my gift, by not rejecting it.”

From that day onward you will start seeing people in their true light, and you will have compassion. And it will not be a cultivated compassion; it will be a natural, spontaneous flow.

Hence people are continuously seeking company. They can’t be with themselves; they want to be with others. People are seeking any type of company; if they can avoid the company of themselves, anything will do. They will sit in a movie house for three hours watching something utterly stupid. They will read a detective novel for hours, wasting their time. They will read the same newspaper again and again just to keep themselves engaged. They will play cards and chess just to kill time—as if they have too much time! We don’t have too much time. We don’t have time enough to grow, to be, to rejoice.

They are responsible for distorting your faces—and they have succeeded; they have made everybody ugly.

Love yourself, love immensely, and in that very love your pride, your ego and all that nonsense, will disappear. And when it has disappeared your love will start reaching to other people. And it will not be a relationship but a sharing. It will not be an object/subject relationship but a melting, a togetherness. It will not be feverish, it will be a cool passion. It will be warm and cool together. It will give you the first taste of the paradoxicalness of life.

To suffer in love is creative; it takes you to higher levels of consciousness. To suffer without love is utterly a waste; it leads you nowhere, it keeps you moving in the same vicious circle.

Hence people are interested in sex, because sex is not risky. It is momentary, you don’t get involved. Love is involvement; it is commitment. It is not momentary. Once it takes roots, it can be forever. It can be a lifelong involvement. Love needs intimacy, and only when you are intimate does the other become a mirror. When you meet sexually with a woman or a man, you have not met at all; in fact, you avoided the soul of the other person. You just used the body and escaped, and the other used your body and escaped.

For the Hindu mind, in the Upanishads they say that you love your wife not for your wife’s sake; you love your wife just for your own sake. You love yourself through her. Because she gives you pleasure, that’s why you love her—but deep down, you love your own pleasure. You love your son, you love your friend, not because of them but because of you. Deep down your son makes you happy, your friend gives you solace. That’s what you are hankering for. So the Upanishads say that you love yourself, really. Even if you say that you love others, that is just a via media to love yourself, a long, roundabout way to love yourself.

Relating means you are always starting, you are continuously trying to become acquainted. Again and again, you are introducing yourself to each other. You are trying to see the many facets of the other’s personality. You are trying to penetrate deeper and deeper into his realm of inner feelings, into the deep recesses of his being.

And each person is such an infinite mystery, inexhaustible, unfathomable, that it is not possible that you can ever say, “I have known her,” or, “I have known him.” At the most you can say, “I have tried my best, but the mystery remains a mystery.” In fact the more you know, the more mysterious the other becomes.

The same happens with your so-called love. You are chasing a woman and the woman goes on withdrawing herself, escaping from you. You become more and more heated up, and then you chase her more. And that’s part of the game. Every woman knows intrinsically that she has to escape, so the chase is continued. Of course she is not to escape so much that you forget all about her—she has to remain in view, alluring, fascinating, calling, inviting and yet escaping.

Love has three dimensions. One is animal-like; it is only lust, a physical phenomenon. The other is manlike; it is higher than lust, than sexuality, than sensuality. It is not just exploitation of the other as a means. The first is only an exploitation; the other is used as a means in the first. In the second the other is not used as a means, the other is equal to you.

Love has three dimensions. One is animal-like; it is only lust, a physical phenomenon. The other is manlike; it is higher than lust, than sexuality, than sensuality. It is not just exploitation of the other as a means. The first is only an exploitation; the other is used as a means in the first. In the second the other is not used as a means, the other is equal to you. The other is as much an end unto herself or himself as you are, and love is not an exploitation but a mutual sharing of your being, of your joys, of your music, of your pure

You are simply loving—not in love with somebody in particular, but simply a state of love, so whatsoever you do, you do it lovingly; whomsoever you meet, you meet lovingly.

A relationship is a koan. And unless you have solved a more fundamental thing about yourself, you cannot solve it. The problem of love can be solved only when the problem of meditation has been solved, not before it. Because it is really two nonmeditative persons who are creating the problem. Two persons who are in confusion, who don’t know who they are—naturally they multiply each other’s confusion, they magnify it.

When you are in love, don’t forget meditation. Love is not going to solve anything. Love is only going to show you who you are, where you are. And it is good that love makes you alert—alert of the whole confusion and the chaos within you. Now is the time to meditate! If love and meditation go together, you will have both the wings, you will have a balance.

How can I know that a woman has fallen in love in reality, and not playing games? This is difficult! Nobody has ever been able to know it because, in fact, love is a game. That is its reality! So if you are waiting and watching and thinking and analyzing whether this woman who is in love with you is just playing a game or is in reality in love, you will never be able to love any woman—because love is a game, the supreme game. There is no need to ask for it to be real. Play the game, that’s its reality. And if you are too much a seeker for reality, then love is not for you. It is a dream, it is a fantasy, it is a fiction—it is romance, it is poetry. If you are too much a seeker after reality, obsessed with reality, then love is not for you. Then meditate.

This continuous anxiety about whether the other’s love is real or not simply shows one thing: that your love is not real. Otherwise, who bothers? Why be worried about it? Enjoy it while it lasts, be together while you can be together! It is a fiction, but you need fiction.

Right now, you are worried too much whether the other loves you, really, because you are not certain about your own love. That’s one thing. And you are not certain about your own worth. You cannot believe that somebody can really love you; you don’t see anything in yourself. You cannot love yourself, how can somebody else love you? It seems unreal, it seems impossible.

There is no way to be certain about the other. First be certain about yourself. And a person who is certain about himself is certain about the whole world. A certainty achieved at your innermost core becomes a certainty about everything that you do and everything that happens to you. Settled, centered, grounded, in yourself, you never worry about such things. You accept. If somebody loves you, you accept it because you love yourself. You are happy with yourself; somebody else is happy—good! It does not get in your head, it does not make you madly egoistic. You simply enjoy yourself; somebody else also finds you enjoyable—good! While it lasts, live the fiction as beautifully as possible—it will not last forever.

And these are the obstacles: jealousies, possessiveness, attachment, expectations, desires . . . And your fear is right: “If all these disappear, will anything be left of my love?” Nothing will be left of your love. Love will be left . . . but love has nothing to do with “I” or “you.” In fact, when all possessiveness, all jealousies, all expectations disappear, love does not disappear—you disappear, the ego disappears. These are the shadows of the ego.

It is not love that is jealous. Watch, look, observe again. When you feel jealous, it is not love that feels jealous; love has never known anything of jealousy. Just as the sun has never known anything of darkness, love has never known anything of jealousy. It is the ego that feels hurt, it is the ego that feels competitive, in a constant struggle.

What you call poetry and passion are nothing but lies—with beautiful facades. Out of your hundred poets, ninety-nine are not really poets but only people in a state of turmoil, emotion, passion, heat, lust, sexuality, sensuality. Only one out of your hundred poets is a real poet. And the real poet may never compose any poetry, because his whole being is poetry. The way he walks, the way he sits, the way he eats, the way he sleeps—it is all poetry. He exists as poetry. He may create poetry, he may not create poetry, that is irrelevant.

Love appears as relationship, but begins in deep solitude. Love expresses as relating, but the source of love is not in relating; the source of love is in meditating. When you are absolutely happy in your aloneness—when you don’t need the other at all, when the other is not a need—then you are capable of love. If the other is your need you can only exploit, manipulate, dominate, but you cannot love.

Jesus says, “It is very difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. A camel may pass through the eye of a needle, but not a rich man into the kingdom of God.” Why? Because a man who has been accumulating riches is trying to become significant through wealth. He wants to be somebody, and whosoever wants to be somebody, the door of the kingdom is closed for him. Only nobodies enter there, only those who have attained to their nothingness, only those whose boats are empty; whose ego needs, they have come to understand, are futile and neurotic; whose ego needs they have come to penetrate and found to be useless—not only useless but harmful, also. Ego needs can make you mad, but they can never fulfill you.

And I am not saying don’t love. In fact, only a person who is capable of being alone is capable of love. Lonely persons cannot love. Their need is so much that they cling—how can they love? Lonely persons cannot love, they can only exploit. Lonely persons pretend to love; deep down they want to get love. They don’t have it to give, they have nothing to give. Only a person who knows how to be alone and joyous is so full of love that he can share it. He can share it with strangers.

This is my effort, to make you independently blissful. That does not mean that you have to renounce the world. That does not mean that you have to leave your wife, your girlfriend, your love for food—even for ice cream; it has nothing to do with that. Your blissfulness is with you whatever you are doing. It will enhance every activity, it will enrich every act that you do. Your love will have a totally different flavor. Now there will not be any hate hiding behind it; it will be simply love. There will not be even the expectation that something should be returned to you. You don’t need anything. Giving is such a benediction, there is no need. You are so rich inside that nothing can make you richer. And you can go on sharing bliss. The more you share it, the more you have it, so nothing can make you poorer. This is the only miracle that I know of.

If a person of meditation becomes cold, he has missed. Then he is just a man of repression. If you repress your passion you will become cold. That’s how the whole humanity has become cold—passion has been repressed in everyone.

In Latin there is a dictum: agere sequitur esse—to do follows to be; action follows being. It is tremendously beautiful. Don’t try to change your action—try to find out your being, and action will follow. The action is secondary; being is primary.

Never judge a man by his actions, judge a man by his being. Sinners have become saints and saints have fallen and become sinners. Each saint has a past and each sinner has a future.

Soon after the death of Rabbi Moshe, Rabbi Mendel of Kotyk asked one of his disciples, “What was most important to your teacher?” The disciple thought and then replied, “Whatever he happened to be doing at the moment.” The moment is the most important thing.

It is beautiful to be alone, it is also beautiful to be in love, to be with people. And they are complementary, not contradictory. When you are enjoying others, enjoy, and enjoy to the full; there is no need to bother about aloneness. And when you are fed up with others, then move into aloneness and enjoy it to the full. Don’t try to choose—if you try to choose you will be in difficulty. Every choice is going to create a division in you, a kind of split in you. Why choose? When you can have both, why have one?

My whole teaching consists of two words, “meditation” and “love.” Meditate so that you can feel immense silence, and love so that your life can become a song, a dance, a celebration. You will have to move between the two, and if you can move easily, if you can move without any effort, you have learned the greatest thing in life.

If two persons are really respectful—and love is always respectful, it reveres the other; it is a very worshipful, prayerful state—then slowly, slowly you will understand each other more and more and you will become aware of the other’s rhythm and your rhythm. And soon you will find that out of love, out of respect, your rhythms are coming closer and closer. When you feel loving, she feels loving; this settles.

Have you watched, ever? If you come across two real lovers, you will see many things similar in them. Real lovers become as if they are brothers and sisters. You will be surprised—even brothers and sisters are not so alike. Their expression, their way of walking, their way of talking, their gestures—two lovers become alike and yet so different. This naturally starts happening. Just being together, slowly, slowly they become attuned to each other. Real lovers need not say anything to the other—the other immediately understands, intuitively understands.

He had always disliked the people who encored a favorite air in an opera—“That just spoils it” had been his comment. But this now appeared to him as a principle of far wider application and deeper moment. This itch to have things over again, as if life were a film that could be unrolled twice or even made to work backward . . . was it possibly the root of all evil? No: of course the love of money was called that. But money itself—perhaps one valued it chiefly as a defense against chance, a security for being able to have things over again, a means of arresting the unrolling of the film.

But while he was thinking this, as suddenly and sharply as if the solid darkness about him had spoken with articulate voice, he knew that Maleldil was not absent. That sense—so very welcome yet never welcomed without the overcoming of a certain resistance—that sense of the Presence which he had once or twice before experienced on Perelandra, returned to him. The darkness was packed quite full.

Long since on Mars, and more strongly since he came to Perelandra, Ransom had been perceiving that the triple distinction of truth from myth and of both from fact was purely terrestrial—was part and parcel of that unhappy division between soul and body which resulted from the Fall.

“I shall never see her again,” he thought, and then, “I shall never again look on a female body in quite the same way as I look on this.” As he stood looking down on her, what was most with him was an intense and orphaned longing that he might, if only for once, have seen the great Mother of his own race thus, in her innocence and splendor. “Other things, other blessings, other glories,” he murmured. “But never that. Never in all worlds, that. God can make good use of all that happens. But the loss is real.”

Everyone must sometimes have wondered why in nearly all tongues certain inanimate objects are masculine and others feminine. What is masculine about a mountain or feminine about certain trees? Ransom has cured me of believing that this is a purely morphological phenomenon, depending on the form of the word. Still less is gender an imaginative extension of sex. Our ancestors did not make mountains masculine because they projected male characteristics into them. The real process is the reverse. Gender is a reality, and a more fundamental reality than sex. Sex is, in fact, merely the adaptation to organic life of a fundamental polarity which divides all created beings. Female sex is simply one of the things that have feminine gender; there are many others, and Masculine and Feminine meet us on planes of reality where male and female would be simply meaningless. Masculine is not attenuated male, nor feminine attenuated female.

Masculine is not attenuated male, nor feminine attenuated female. On the contrary the male and female of organic creatures are rather faint and blurred reflections of masculine and feminine. Their reproductive functions, their differences in strength and size, partly exhibit, but partly also confuse and misrepresent, the real polarity.

“Most of them,” said Ransom, “have ceased to think of such things at all. Some of us still have the knowledge: but I did not at once see what you were talking of, because what you call the beginning we are accustomed to call the Last Things.” “I do not call it the beginning,” said Tor the King. “It is but the wiping out of a false start in order that the world may then begin. As when a man lies down to sleep, if he finds a twisted root under his shoulder he will change his place and after that his real sleep begins. Or as a man setting foot on an island, may make a false step. He steadies himself and after that his journey begins. You would not call that steadying of himself a last thing?”
